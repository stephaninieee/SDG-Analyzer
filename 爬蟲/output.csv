1,no-poverty,A New Page of Architecture,"E Ink’s E-paper products offer benefits such as energy saving, portability, and eco-health. The biggest difference from other display technologies is that E-paper is a reflective and bi-stable display technology. Visually, it looks almost the same as traditional paper but with the benefits of eye protection and energy efficiency. ""Magnetrix Curtain"" is an e-paper glass curtain wall system that uses magnetic coupling induction coils to combine E-paper’s power supply and control. It encapsulates the electronic paper and its auxiliary circuits inside the two layers of glass, completely isolated from the outside world and packaged in the architectural curtain in a matrix pattern. In the external wall system, environmental information about the building is displayed on the wall through the control of the APP and each node. The 1:1 mock-up installation showcases the detailed components of the construction. The gap in the double-pane glass of the curtain wall system can be used as a display shelf.
This project hopes to use E-paper as a building material and apply it to exterior wall systems or surface finishes and so revolutionize the construction of architectural facade building materials. Professor Cheng-Luen Hsueh and Professor Kane Yanagawa in the Department of Architecture and Professor Jia-You Lee in the Department of Electrical Engineering formed a team to explore the future economic system of the construction industry from the perspective of circular economy and to pursue the possibility of E-paper as a new building material. E-paper’s readability makes it one of the most important and key technologies for future life. The research and development team sought to apply E-paper to architectural facade building materials and to use E-paper to display environmental protection information such as PM value, power consumption, and temperature. In addition, the R&D team also explored how to integrate this technology into the production and construction of building exteriors, and inspired by circular economy to practice modular, systematic, easily changeable, or leasable new business models.
元太科技的電子紙與其他顯示器技術最大的不同在於其反射式、雙穩態的顯示技術，在視覺上與傳統紙張幾乎無異，能創造護眼、節能的效益。「Magnetrix Curtain」以磁耦感應線圈結合電子紙的供電與控制，並將電子紙及附屬電路封裝於雙層玻璃內部與外界完全隔絕，以矩陣圖案封裝在建築帷幕外牆系統內，透過網站和各個節點的控制，將屋內的環境感知資訊顯示於牆面。
1:1 的裝置嘗試了建築外牆尺度的構造與施工，帷幕玻璃單元同時也在雙層玻璃之間構成一個玻璃櫥窗。此裝置期望以電子紙為材料並將其運用於外牆系統或是表面飾材，並帶來革命性的建築皮層材料的變革。本專案以建築系的薛丞倫老師、柳川肯老師與電機系李嘉猷老師組成研發團隊，試圖從循環經濟的角度探討未來建築產業的新經濟系統以及從建築的角度探討電子紙作為建築新材料的可能性。研發團隊的研究方向設定為將電子紙應用於建築皮層材料，並透過電子紙展現建築內的PM值、耗電量及溫度等環境感知資訊。此外研發團隊也試圖探討如何融入建築外牆既有生產到施工的生態，啟發在循環經濟思考下，模組化、系統性、易更換、或租賃式的新商業模式的實踐。

另外，跨國界下移民與健康之間的問題：臺灣、英國和海洋國家的比較研究也是現今社會的重要議題，老齡化一直是全球的問題。2019年，英國、紐西蘭、台灣和馬來西亞的老年人口比例分別為18%、15%、14%和6.7%。以上所有島國都是海洋文化，這些國家有很多華人移民。根據英國的人口普查，2011年華人移民有40萬人口；紐西蘭統計數據顯示，2013年超過1億位。此外，華人移民是馬來西亞第二大民族，2010年占馬來西亞首都的43.2%。
台灣、英國、紐西蘭、馬來西亞的華人常青會、老年學會、宗族協會等長者，為長者提供教育或進行友好接觸。本研究利用他們的集會時間發佈調查問卷，並要求他們填寫調查問卷。四大海洋文化國家研究中，華人老年人口的跨國比較是一個新的課題。研究學者可以擴大研究領域，同時為公眾提供老齡化問題的新視角。經過12個月的研究，有望了解英國、紐西蘭、台灣、馬來西亞四個海洋文化國家華人老年人的特點、老齡化問題、社會支持狀況、老年人常見病和生理指標（生理功能、心理、認知功能）。

2,zero-hunger,Taiwan NCKU Top 2 university in Asia in THE University Impact Ranking,"The Times Higher Education (THE) magazine on Thursday (April 22) released the Impact Rankings 2020, and two Taiwanese universities were on the list, with National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) at 38th in the world and 2nd in Asia, a new record high for Taiwanese schools in the world's four major ranking agencies.

NCKU President Dr. Huey-Jen Su (蘇慧貞) mentioned that the school was one of the first universities in the country to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Su linked the extraordinary achievement to the school's wide range of applications, from internal affairs in campus, to participating in international medical and humanity rescue services.
The Impact Rankings were evaluated based on each university’s ability to support and deliver on the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals. NCKU stood out in the categories of SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG9 (Industry Innovations and Infrastructure), and SDG14 (Life Below Water) across the higher education sector — of which it ranked among the top 20 in the world.

2,zero-hunger,NCKU’s Angel Fund Helps Students to Realize Their Entrepreneurial Dreams,"Two university students who received Angel Fund offered by the Creativity, Innovation& Entrepreneurship Center (CIE Center) at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) setting to chase entrepreneurial dream finally paid off when they recently set up their own business, Fandora, an on-line community for the graphic artists.
Steven Su（蘇晏良）from NCKU Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering and Adrian Chen（陳俊穎）from NCKU Institute of Physics said that we received training courses from NCKU and the NT$50,000 grant offered by Angel Fund and after we graduated we’re able to develop our own brand, Fandora.
Fandora was established in October, 2011, and its goal is to help artists to gain profits continuing their creation, according to Su. “People can easily find the works they like and interact with the artists in Fandora.”
Within two years, Fandora has become a famous brand name and has elected as the Star of Cultural and Creative Industry of the first session by the Ministry of Culture in Taiwan.
Chen said, “Now, Fandora is the biggest graphic art-based platform in Taiwan, which owns about 2,000 artists, 20,000 members and more than 20,000 art works.”
“We believe in the power of art. Not everyone can create great art works, and also not everyone have the chance to own them,” according to Chen who added that Fandora offers both artists and general public a chance to be seen and people can show their taste through owning art print products with affordable price.
Every single sale will become the fund for the artist directly to support them create artworks, Su noted.
Su and Chen knew each other by participation of student affairs in college. Yet it was until they attended the courses of CIE Center and were inspired by the center’s founder, Professor Harold Szu, the entrepreneurial idea has come to their mind.
Chen said, Angel Fund was originally built for general business for speeding progress. Hence, in the beginning, they used the whole funding on purchasing equipment.
However, compared with the other big companies such as IBM and HP which provide similar services, it’s not easy for them to gain trusts from clients. Therefore, they reoriented themselves.
Su and Chen both appreciated the assistance CIE Center provided to them, so they can reify their ideas and created Fandora, combining the meanings of “Fan” and “Pandora box.”
The members of Fandora are art-lovers and artists, and so far there are nearly 20,000 members. In the future, the variety of products will be broadened including notebook, book cover, and card etc, enabling customers to create their own personalized product. In present, the monthly income is about 400,000 NT dollars.
Su said, for now there are 4 partners including 3 graduates from NCKU and 1 from NTU. Concerning future progress, he has faith that their monthly income will be up to 10 million dollars.
In addition to the success of Fandora, CIE center has assist more than 50 student entrepreneurial projects, which includes some newly-formed companies such as EatMe, Healthlife, and Liwi, and other cases such as Jiongjiong mask designed by student from Department of Physics, children’s dental product design, Chinese-styled creative T-shirt, baseball groves for player Hong-Chih Kuo, Saving From Poverty Project, PhiStorage quantum cloud data system, Evergreen Life-kitchenware for single elders, and Soap Slicer-paper soap dispensers etc.
用創新、創意、創業等全新思維，為教學注入一股活水的成功大學三創研發中心，啟蒙學生的創業夢，多年紮根終於顯現亮麗成果了。兩位曾接受三創研發中心課程訓練並取得天使金的資助、然後開展創業路的校友成大電通所99級蘇晏良與成大物理所100級陳俊穎，自創Fandora品牌，創業不到兩年，已擦亮品牌，獲選為文化部第一屆文創之星，美夢成真，消息傳回成大，學校師長以及學弟妹們都感到與有榮焉。
開創Fandora品牌的成大電通所99級的蘇晏良與成大物理所100級陳俊穎，兩人在大學時代因共同參與學生事務而結為好友，但當時並沒有創業想法，直到修習了三創課程，深受三創研發中心創辦人、國際知名學者斯華齡教授的啟蒙，順利獲得三創研發中心天使金五萬元補助後，於是開啟了創業夢。
陳俊穎說，當初的天使金計畫是為一般企業量身打造高速進行的系統，因此五萬元補助全部投入購買設備，但是相較於IBM、HP等提供同樣服務的大企業，難以取得客戶信任，因此重新思考創業的新方向。
成大天使金對學生創業的幫助，兩人都覺得深受其惠，現在他們將獨創的概念具體呈現，創造了Fandora這個結合「Fan」以及「Pandora(潘朵拉) box」意涵，匯集藝術展示以及加值販售的社群平台，於100年11月30日正式成立，目的在讓藝術家有足夠獲利後，可以有動力持續創作。
Fandora匯集了國內近2000名插畫家、超過20,000件創作，提供消費者自行選購圖案，印製成手機殼、T恤等，社群成員則是藝術愛好者以及藝術家，吸引近兩萬名會員。未來還將拓展商品種類，包括筆記本、書衣、卡片等等，都可以由消費者自行選印喜愛的插畫，成為個人化商品，目前月營業額為40萬。
蘇晏良表示，現在合夥人有3名成大畢業生與1名台大畢業生，對於未來，他有信心可以上看新台幣1000萬元。他期待，成大能夠多多提供諮詢管道，繼續輔導學生創業。
除了Fandora這個成功案例，綜觀過去，三創研發中心協助學生創業計畫超過五十件，包括正式成立公司的食我部落、澄榕資訊有限公司、LiWi股份有限公司。其他還有物理系的學生開發「囧囧罩」產品、兒童牙醫產品設計、中國風創意T恤設計、郭泓志手套設計、搶救貧窮大作戰計畫、PhiStorage量子雲資料系統、長青生活-獨居老人系列餐廚用品、Soap slicer 紙皂機等等。成大102年度天使金創業計畫評選，5月底已選出8個團隊，分別給予1-3萬元不等的補助，其中不乏亮點計畫，可望再度造就更多明日之星。
成大三創研發中心於96年8月斯華齡講座教授應邀在成大正式成立，其天使金計畫主要在協助學生培養創意、創新和創業家精神之能力，以及增長學生判斷、分析能力，開啟實際創業機會給予學生體驗，提供生涯規劃之選擇方向，滿足社會所需及豐富學術價值。
斯華齡講座教授因美國實驗室繁忙，不得已已回到美國，但仍關注三創的發展，不時透過網路視訊加以指導，秉持斯華齡講座教授信念的同仁也沒讓他失望持續推動三創，因此成大三創研發中心所推動的創新、創意、創業課程，不僅成大學生喜歡，名聲也遠播國外，世界各地有許多學校，包括中國的北京大學、復旦大學、清華大學、以及新加坡知名大學都曾來詢問是否可申請、加入成大三創中心的天使金計畫。

3,good-health-and-well-being,The Pain Will Fly Away – Art Exhibition for Epidermolysis Bullosa,"Passersby will be greeted by a hallway of artwork when entering the lobby of NCKU College of Medicine. Opening till mid-March, this exhibition, named The Pain Will Fly Away, is part of a series of charity events by NCKU International Center for Wound Repair and Regeneration (iWRR), which aims to help people with Epidermolysis Bullosa, which causes skin fragility. The art pieces in the exhibition are made by artists who themselves are living with Epidermolysis Bullosa, and the artists express their life experiences through their art creation.
Huey-Jen Jenny Su, President of NCKU, Yan-Shen Shan, Dean of College of Medicine, and Meng-Ru Shen, Superintendent of NCKU Hospital, all showed their support for the actions helping EB patients. The art exhibition and a musical concert were held in the hope of bringing everyone to spread warmth and love.
EB, or Epidermolysis Bullosa, is a group of inherited rare blistering disorders, with an incidence of around 1/50,000 worldwide. EB is characterized by skin fragility since birth and abnormal wound healing. Patients tend to have diverse clinical manifestations as well as blistering of varying degrees depending on different clinical subtypes; in addition, there are 21 known EB-related genes, making it difficult to diagnose based on mere clinical pictures and traditional sequencing techniques.
In the exhibition The Pain Will Fly Away, art pieces by EB patients and their family members are displayed, including paintings, patchworks, and installation arts. Ink painting artist Jo-Chun Hsu saw the fragility in the EB community and thus visited fellow patients and encouraged them to create art with inspiration from their experience, putting their daily lives into their works.
Even with a simple hole puncher, an artist was able to create art by documenting daily pain through hole punching. The 10-meter art piece impresses viewers with its appearance.
""It is our honor to learn from those living with EB,"" said iWRR Director Ming-Jer Tang, ""we promise to keep the spirit of sustainability and continue to make improvements for the society with medical technology.""
An interdisciplinary clinic for EB patients was established in NCKU Hospital in March, 2020. This clinic gathers expertise from various fields aiming to provide integrative and tailored care. A team from NCKU iWRR focuses their research energy on EB, utilizing whole exome sequencing and various pathological and molecular technologies, and has successfully completed genetic diagnoses in 70 Taiwanese EB patients. The detailed genetic background paves a way to genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis, and the arrangement of personalized medicine. Hitherto, there is no cure for EB, and the supportive care such as daily wound dressing, anti-septic agents and antihistamines is still the mainstay. According to the underlying causative mutations, NCKU EB team works with renowned experts worldwide to arrange individualized therapy for Taiwanese EB patients, including biological agents and cell therapy.
Besides striving to alleviate physical discomforts in EB patients, NCKU EB team also pays attention to providing psychological support for patients. Aside from the current joint art exhibition The Pain Will Fly Away, two charitable music concerts were also held for EB. In addition, the team organized drama camps for not only the patients but also their siblings and parents, guiding them to express their inner feelings and helping the family to manage their emotions and stress properly.
To make medical services more approachable to these patients, the team also arranged an International EB workshop in January 2021 and exchanged the experiences of EB care among different hospitals and countries. Currently, the team is collaborating with several international medical teams devoting to the investigation of EB pathobiology, finding out therapies with prospects of curing EB. In the end, the shared ultimate goal is to provide the patients and the families with a smiley face, a warming heart, and a better life.
「吹一吹、痛痛飛，泡泡龍病友聯合創作展」在國立成功大學成杏校區醫學院一樓大廳迴廊展出到3月中。成大校長蘇慧貞、成大醫學院院長沈延盛、成大附設醫院院長沈孟儒等皆到場參與，用行動支持泡泡龍患者，為公益盡一份心力。在生命的傷痕中，藉由音樂得到治癒，集結眾人的力量，將愛擴散出去，嘉惠更多泡泡龍患者。
「遺傳性表皮分解型水皰症」俗稱泡泡龍症，因為先天基因缺損而導致表皮異常脆弱，嚴重者甚至體無完膚。罕見疾病治療不易，牽動病友整個家庭甚至家族。成功大學團隊與成大醫院秉持人性化醫療精神，推行從個人到全人、從病人到家人的照護模式，展現人性關懷、科技醫療，整合社會資源舉辦聯合創作展與公益音樂會，邀請各界深入體會罕見疾病患者的強韌生命力。
這次聯合創作展匯集近40位病友與他們父母親的作品，包含：繪畫、拼布、裝置藝術等。水墨畫家也是泡泡龍病友徐若鈞，看見泡泡龍群體的脆弱，逐一拜訪病友，從每一個人與生俱來的想像力出發，鼓勵他們以生命與生活中的點滴作為創作素材。
一位20歲的嚴重型病友，原認為自己沒有藝術天份，用簡單的打洞機，在紙捲上打洞，以洞的數量和密度，記錄每天在自己身上發生的各種疼痛，最終竟完成長達10公尺震撼視覺的作品。病友協會理事長古寶英女士說：「當病友開始專心畫畫，竟然就暫時忘記身體的搔癢與疼痛。」
「我無法改變自己的長相，但也許你可以改變看人的想法」。泡泡龍病友齡從6歲到60歲都有，在一處名為「能量集中站」的展覽中，他們寫下從小到大所聽過的各種評論及話語，有最殘酷的，也有最美麗的，一位病友有感而發地說，「其實每個人都一樣，若想看到人們真正的模樣，就要用心去看。」
「從病人身上學習，是我們的榮幸。」成功大學國際傷口修復與再生中心主任湯銘哲教授說，我們承諾以永續的態度，延續成大豐厚的醫學人文底蘊，深耕精準醫療與智慧醫療，持續造福人群。

3,good-health-and-well-being,成大校友嚴瑞雄號召口罩國家隊成軍,"The out-of-control epidemic has placed the face-mask supply in Taiwan into chaos and resulted in collective anxiety. The leaders of Taiwan’s machine tools industry have suspended their businesses and formed a national team to assist with the supply of surgical masks without compensation. Their actions provided hope in a time of darkness, and this may enable the public to continue buying face masks.
Minister of Economic Affairs, Shen Jong-chin, guaranteed that an additional 60 production lines for face masks will be in place by mid-March at the latest. By this time, each production line should produce 100,000 face masks each day, increasing the daily mask production capacity by 6 million. With the existing daily production capacity of 4 million masks, Taiwan will become the world’s second largest producer of masks with 10 million face masks per day.
Since the commencement of the Year of the Rat in 2020, the number of confirmed cases and deaths due to Covid-19 around the world have continued to rise. Thus, face masks have become strategic materials affecting national security. Fighting over face masks has become commonplace. In some cases, businesses unable to purchase face masks have resorted to fighting over production equipment to produce their own masks in order to maintain their business operations.
Some businesses have disclosed that in addition to the shortages of face masks, production equipment and parts are in short supply. Under these challenging conditions, Premier Su and Minister Shen have maintained their confidence in the supply because of the support of the national team of made-in-Taiwan (MIT) face-mask machinery suppliers.
The national team comprises technical and human resources from national-level research institutes in addition to national level research institutes and the Precision Machinery Research & Development Center (PMC). The team also has support from major machine tool companies Tongtai, Takisawa Taiwan, Yeong Chin Machinery Industries (YCM), Awea Mechantronics, HIWIN Technologies, and HiWin Mikrosystems.
In normal times, the members of this national team are leaders of their industries, and their combined production value approaches NT$100 billion. The epidemic unexpectedly induced these business owners to suspend their own businesses and become volunteers. In addition to providing staffing, labor, and parts without seeking compensation, they have voluntarily combined to form a strong, national team, which is without precedence.
The key figure in the rapid formation of the national team was Yen Jui-Hsiung—the honorary chairman of the Taiwan Machine Tool & Accessory Builders’ Association and the chairman of TTGroup.
At the end of January 2020, the government announced the expropriation of face masks throughout Taiwan, the centralization of the sale of face masks, and the creation of new government owned face masks production lines. When seeing this news, TTGroup Chairman Yen intuitively sensed that something was wrong. The cause of the problem may have been the technical threshold for mask production machinery, a lack of materials and labor, or a lack of production equipment.
Even with sufficient materials, face masks cannot be produced if the most basic equipment is missing. After clarifying the cause, Yen immediately recruited industry colleagues within his association to assist in the creation of production lines. Unexpectedly, these busy business owners put aside their own businesses to assist immediately.
Lai Yung-hsiang recalled that on February 4th, 2020, when the government announced the limited sale of face masks based on a real-name system, he and the Industrial Technology Research Institute along with similar corporate bodies met with the Ministry of Economic Affairs to discuss how to accelerate the construction of production lines for face masks. The same day, Yen called Lai on behalf of the Taiwan Machine Tool & Accessory Builders’ Association to ask for his help.
Therefore, TTGroup Chairman Yen and Takisawa President Winston Tai personally led a team of elite technicians with technologies and spare parts from YCM, deta International, TPI Bearings, HIWIN Technologies, and Awea. Lai described with great emotion, that “these people are all ace batters—once they arrive at work, they squat down for low level work like wiring, and they don’t leave until 10 pm.”
This team of 120 elite professional create a production value of approximately NT$200 million every 2 months. However, not only did they not seek compensation for their work, they even brought their own lunches, rented their own accommodation, and used their own tool boxes. Their only goal was to ensure that face masks production lines could open as soon as possible and alleviate the public’s uneasiness.
During a pandemic, a shortage of face masks can lead to collective anxiety and the potential collapse of society. Fortunately, the human instinct to help each other is a sign of hope in the dark times.

3,good-health-and-well-being,NCKU Collaborates with Professional Tennis Player Su-Wei Hsieh to Support Patients with Epidermolysis Bullosa through the Love and Scar Charity Concert,"Patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) have difficult-to-heal wounds and must use gauzes throughout their lives; this results in a substantial financial and psychological burden for patients and their families. National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) has invested in treatment and research for EB over a long period; to draw attention to the disease, the university organized the “Love and Scar Charity Concert” in January 2020. Renowned international tennis player Su-Wei Hsieh is particularly moved by the desire of patients with EB to reduce their gauze usage and engage in the free movement. As an athlete who has always declined endorsement, Hsieh is enthusiastic about recording a charity video and supporting this charity concert for patients with EB. She hopes to encourage the public’s active engagement in this event and actions to express their support and love for patients with EB.
The Love and Scar Charity Concert was held at the National Taichung Theater and National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts (Weiwuying) on January 3 and January 5, 2020, respectively; the profits were donated to the Taiwan Epidermolysis Bullosa Association. Professor Shi-Wen Chin, winner of the National Award for Arts, was invited to compose a piece for the concert and to conduct the Yinqi Chamber Orchestra to play this piece. Through a multimedia narrative featuring stories and music, NCKU hopes that music enthusiasts can expand and share their love of music, while also helping patients and their families to find hope through music.
The International Center for Wound Repair and Regeneration of NCKU held a press conference to announce the Love and Scar Charity Concert on December 23. They shared concert details and played the video recorded by Hsieh for patients with EB (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtAS9aMADl4). Patients with EB must use gauze throughout their lives, and Hsieh, who has experienced numerous injuries through her training, encouraged these patients to transform their pain and scars into a form of power in their life.
Miss Li, a patient with EB, also attended the press conference to raise public awareness about EB. She said that the skin of patients with EB is extremely fragile; a small amount of external friction can cause blisters, which burst and form wet, ulcerated wounds, which occurs repeatedly. Furthermore, these blisters sting and itch and thus causes patients to scratch and ultimately results in bleeding. The blisters may even grow inside patients’ mouths and cause difficulty swallowing, which often leads to malnourishment. Moreover, patients’ mucous membranes are easily damaged, which reduces their immunity. In addition to physical injuries, patients are also subject to staring and bullying through their childhood to adulthood. As Miss Li spoke about her experiences, tears welled up her eyes, and she choked up several times. However, she stressed that patients do not need sympathy or compassion; instead, they need actual care. She hoped that the public would support the Taiwan Epidermolysis Bullosa Association and enable the association to gain the power to assist more patients.
The Director of the International Center for Wound Repair and Regeneration, Ming-Jer Tang, said that they have received support and assistance from many people since the organization of the concert and compared this to divine intervention. Hsieh’s willingness to help promote the concert was an unexpected surprise and was like a gift from god. Through love, we have more strength to fight against and cure the disease.
According to Tang, EB has a prevalence of 1 in 50,000, and approximately 100 patients in Taiwan have moderate to severe symptoms. The epidermis (i.e., the skin, mouth, and digestive tract) of a patient is fragile, and blisters and wounds can form after slight external friction. Moreover, patients with severe symptoms are prone to skin cancer in adulthood. Patients must spend many hours changing their dressings and treating wounds every day for their entire lives. The special dressing required results in a considerable financial burden, and patients and their families often turn to folk prescriptions, resulting in a vicious cycle.
No cure for EB is currently available; the medical research team at NCKU has collaborated with the international community for many years to identify the genes responsible for this disease, improve diagnosis and treatment, and develop personalized treatment and preventions of complications. Moreover, they have started to establish a gene database and genetic consultation services as well as strengthened the relevant care training and social support system. NCKU hopes that society can care for, actively support, and strengthen those combating EB.

罕見遺傳性皮膚疾病「泡泡龍症」，病患終身無法擺脫傷口與紗布，病患及家屬在經濟及心理負擔上都很大。成大長期投入相關治療與研究，為喚起社會對疾病的關注與認識，2020年1月將舉辦「愛與傷痕公益音樂會」。國際網球好手謝淑薇，長年在球場自由馳騁，對泡泡龍病友渴望擺脫紗布、自由活動的心願格外有感，向來婉拒代言的她，熱心拍攝公益影片、支持公益音樂會，期待各界踴躍發揮愛心，以行動支持一起為泡泡龍病友綻放出美麗。
「愛與傷痕公益音樂會」2020年1月3日、5日，分別在台中國家歌劇院與高雄衛武營音樂廳舉行，所得全數捐予「臺灣泡泡龍病友協會」。音樂會邀得國家文藝獎得主金希文教授製作曲目並指揮「音契室內管弦樂團」演出。透過故事與音樂的多媒體敘事，讓愛樂者把對音樂的喜好擴散為愛的分享，也讓病友與家屬在音樂中擁有希望。
耶誕節已然到來，成大國際傷口修復與再生中心12月23日舉辦「愛與傷痕公益音樂會」記者會，分享舉辦音樂會的初衷並播放謝淑薇為泡泡龍病友拍攝的影片（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtAS9aMADl4）。泡泡龍終身為紗布為伍，謝淑薇長年練球大小傷不斷，她鼓勵病友將病痛與不美麗的傷痕，轉化成生命另一層力量。
希望社會大眾認識泡泡龍症，病友李小姐特地出席記者會。她表示，泡泡龍症病人的皮膚很脆弱，稍有外力摩擦就形成水疱，泡泡破了變成溼爛傷口，情況反覆發生，加上泡泡會刺痛、會癢，忍不住想抓，往往皮破血流。泡泡龍症患者甚至連口腔也會長泡，吞食困難，因此往往營養不良，加上體內黏膜也容易受傷，影響抵抗力。有形的傷之外，還有他人異樣眼光或言語霸凌，小時候到大從來沒少過。說到傷心處，李小姐眼角泛淚，幾度難過得無法言語。但她強調，病友不需要同情與憐憫，需要的是實質關懷，期待各界支持泡泡龍病友協會，讓瘦弱的病友協會多長些肉，幫助更多的病患。
國際傷口修復與再生中心主任湯銘哲表示，籌辦音樂會以來，得到許多人的支持與協助，彷彿冥冥中得到神助。更意想不到的是，網球好手謝淑薇願意幫忙宣傳，真是天上掉下來的禮物。有了愛，對抗與治療疾病會更有力量。
湯銘哲表示，俗稱泡泡龍症的「遺傳性表皮鬆解型水泡症」，罹病率為5萬分之1，全台中重度病友約100位，可說是弱勢中的弱勢。患者全身表皮（皮膚、口腔、消化道）異常脆弱，稍有外力摩擦就會形成水疱與傷口，嚴重者成年後也容易形成皮膚癌化。患者終其一生，每天要花費數小時換藥與傷口處理。價錢昂貴的特殊敷料是沈重的經濟負擔，病患與家屬往往因不堪折磨轉向偏方藥，造成惡性循環。
目前的醫學對泡泡龍症尚無根治之道，成大醫學研究團隊多年來與國際合作研究致病基因提昇診斷治療，以期採用更為個人化的治療，預防或減輕併發症。也著手建立基因資料庫與遺傳諮詢，以提供防治基礎。同時也強化照護培訓與社會支持系統。希望社會關心、積極支持這一群與疾病對抗的鬥士，為他們帶來更多力量。

3,good-health-and-well-being,NCKU introduces smart medicine to improve clinical quarantine efficiency of COVID-19,"Video：https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg7r14j1_r4Video for Students：https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0xA5jpJiF4&feature=youtu.be

In order to combat the severe epidemic of the new type of coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), Su Huey-Jen, the president of National Cheng Kung University, led the NCKU and affiliated medical centers to integrate a number of smart medical treatments. They established a ""smart medical clinical decision support system"" to increase quarantine efficiency by 5 to 6 times. The time required for a high-risk patient to enter quarantine after the physician's diagnosis was originally 2 and a half hours. After smart medicine integration, it can be completed in less than 30 minutes. Smart medicine can also reduce the risk of cross-infection between medical staff, patients and the quarantine staffs. At the same time, the NCKU interdisciplinary team created the home quarantine policy with a ""WEN-SHIN（溫心）smart band"". Shan Yan-Shen, the dean of the medical college, and Shen Meng-Ru, the president of the NCKU Hospital stated that since the epidemic struck, NCKU and NCKU hospital immediately mobilized for epidemic prevention. The establishment of a smart medical system will make the quarantine work more efficiently with more reliability.
The Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) has traditionally supported NCKU's development in the smart medical care field. Xie Da-Bin, the Deputy Minister of Science and Technology, stated that NCKU has grasped and utilized the latest scientific and technological trends.
The ""Smart Medical Clinical Decision Assistance System"" includes front-end medical record automation, chest X-ray artificial intelligence to assist in the interpretation of pneumonia, and real-time updated clinical decisions based on the latest daily epidemic development provided by the CDC. This results in greatly improving the decision-making in quarantine and prevention.
NCKU also adopts intelligent monitoring for students living in school dormitories under home quarantine. The ""WEN-SHIN（溫心）smart band"" developed by an NCKU interdisciplinary team continuously monitors body temperature and heartrate as predictive symptoms indicators. When the body temperature of the wearer rises, the mobile phone APP can be used to help confirm the abnormal symptoms and remind the student to seek medical treatment. At present, the bands are regularly collected every week, and then management personnel uploads the data to a cloud platform for follow-up. Shan Yan-Shen, the dean of NCKU Medical College, stated that NCKU's home-based quarantine measures are thorough and rigorous and are a model system for Taiwan.
NCKU Hospital is highly vigilant against the epidemic situation and does not show any slackness due to the Chinese New Year. The director of the hospital, Shen Meng-Ru, started the “Wuhan Pneumonia Clinical Quarantine Station” before Chinese New Year. The first step was to set up 8 high-specification tent quarantine stations outside the emergency room as the front line of epidemic prevention sites. At the same time, modular quarantine house stations were built to improve the anti-epidemic preparedness specifications. Shen Meng-Ru said that the epidemic prevention tent is a “high pressure situation”. The patients are uneasy and the medical staff are under great psychological pressure. Therefore, the hospital is committed to standardizing and speeding up the entire process to prevent the risk of infection.
In the second step, the research results of the ""AI Biomedical Research Center at National Cheng Kung University"" and the ""Top-notch Integration Project"" of the Ministry of Science and Technology were included into the smart medical treatment in large hospitals to automate medical records. , Close contact during traditional paper work filling or verbal inquiry of medical history may increase the risk of infection between medical staff and patients. The automated medical record system allows patients to use tablets to independently fill in travel history, occupation history, contact history, cluster history… etc. Medical record data is uploaded into the electronic medical record system, and medical staff can immediately identify relevant data for clinical decision-making. Each tablet will be disinfected with alcohol after patient use.
The third step was the introduction of AI-assisted detection of pneumonia. ""Chest X-Ray Artificial Intelligence Interpretation of Pneumonia System Model"" was developed by the AI  and the hospital information teams of NCKU Hospital. The pneumonia image data of NCKU Hospital was uploaded and is currently used to assist 152 patients with suspected COVID-19 screening. The sensitivity and accuracy can be achieve 80% and 90% accuracy.
The quarantine 3-step project from NCKU Hospital combined with the latest daily epidemic development provided by the CDA, for example the expansion of the epidemic prevention control area, was integrated into a ""smart medical clinical decision support system"".This system is built into the computer system at the quarantine station so clinical decisions during the epidemic are no longer stressful for medical staff.
In order to avoid the continuous infection of people with virus, monitoring and forecasting is very important part. NCKU's multi-disciplinary team and the technology manufacturer Pan-Xu Intelligent（盤旭）jointly developed a ""WEN-SHIN（溫心）smart band "". The band can continuously monitor the patient's body temperature and heartrate. Before the fever, there is an early rise in body surface temperature.

為對抗新型冠狀病毒肺炎（武漢肺炎）嚴峻疫情，成功大學校長蘇慧貞領導大學校本部與附屬醫學中心整合多項智慧醫療，建制「智慧醫療臨床決策輔助系統」，將檢疫效率一舉提高5至6倍。原本高風險病人從踏入檢疫站到醫師做出臨床決策的時間從原本需2個半小時，現在不到30分鐘即可完成，還可有效降低醫護人員和病人交叉感染的風險以及檢疫所需人力。同時，成大跨域團隊也以「溫心智慧手環」協助落實居家檢疫的政策。蘇慧貞期盼在疫情籠罩之下，成大導入智慧醫療能創造30分鐘守護全世界的新可能性。醫學院院長沈延盛與成大醫院院長沈孟儒皆表示，自疫情來襲，成大與成醫即刻動員進行防疫，是項智慧醫療系統的建制將令檢疫工作更為迅速確實。
科技部向來支持成大發展智慧醫療，科技部次長謝達斌表示，成大掌握最新科技動向且不忘以人為本、落地生根，令使科技產生實質造福社會。
「智慧醫療臨床決策輔助系統」包括前端的病歷自動化，胸部X光片人工智慧輔助判讀肺炎，還有最後再依疾管署提供的每日最新疫情發展，隨時更新臨床決策，大大提升成大醫院在檢疫、防疫的應變與決策。
成大對於住在學校宿舍執行居家檢疫的學生也採用智慧化監測，跨領域團隊開發的「溫心智慧手環」能連續監測體溫與心跳，作為預測症狀指標。當配戴者體溫上升時，可以藉由手機APP主動確認異常症狀並提醒主動就醫。目前每個禮拜定期回收手環，再交由管理人員統一上傳數據資料至雲端平台做後續追蹤。成大醫學院院長沈延盛表示，成大在住校居家檢疫的措施周全嚴謹，可謂全台楷模。
成大醫院對疫情高度警戒，不因過年而有絲毫懈怠，醫院院長沈孟儒過年前即啟動成大醫院「武漢肺炎臨床檢疫站」三部曲。第一部曲是在急診室外設8個高規格野戰帳篷檢疫站，做為最前線的防疫場所，同時興建組合屋式檢疫站，提升防疫戰備規格，為未來可能有社區感染疫情做長期抗戰的準備。沈孟儒說，防疫帳篷其實是一個壓力站，病患不安、醫護人員心理壓力大，所以醫院致力讓整個流程標準化、快速化，以阻絕感染風險。
第二部曲將科技部「成大AI人工智慧創新研究中心」暨「拔尖整合計畫」的研究成果，結合成大醫院智慧醫療的能量，做到醫療病歷自動化。相較於傳統紙筆填寫或口頭詢問病史，近距離接觸恐增加醫護人員與病患接觸感染風險，醫療病歷自動化系統讓病患使用平板自主填寫旅遊史、職業史、接觸史、群聚史等病歷資料，上傳到電子病歷系統，醫護人員就能立即收到相關資料做臨床決策，每次平板使用過後，就會以酒精消毒，降低交叉感染風險也提升檢疫站時效。
第三部曲則是導入肺炎AI輔助偵測。「胸部X光人工智慧判讀肺炎系統模型」為成大醫院AI團隊與醫院資訊團隊開發，導入成大醫院的肺炎影像資料，目前用於輔助152例疑似武漢肺炎篩檢，敏感度與準確性可達80%及90%。
成大醫院檢疫三部曲，最後再結合疾管署提供的每日最新疫情發展，例如防疫管制區的擴大等資訊，整合成的「智慧醫療臨床決策輔助系統」，建構於檢疫站的電腦系統，讓因應疫情變化的臨床決策不再成為醫護人員壓力。病患從進入檢疫站到醫師決定是否需要通報住院隔離或居家檢疫觀察，也得以從2個半小時縮減至不到30分鐘。
為避免疫情持續擴散，監測與預測也是相當重要的一環，成大跨領域團隊與科技廠商磐旭智能共同開發「溫心智慧手環」。手環能連續監測病患的體溫及心跳，在發燒之前，會有前期的體表溫度上升，透過配戴手環，可以預警發燒。掌握溫度趨勢變化做到隨時監測、及時警覺異常，提醒及早採取適當行動。目前成大醫院有超過130位的醫護同仁自願配戴溫心智慧手環，成大目前居家檢疫中的學生、疑似病例及其家戶接觸者，也以溫心智慧手環進行連續體溫檢測。
在此次抗疫中，醫院、醫學院、電機資訊學院、理學院、管理學院組成跨領域、跨院系、跨團隊等，結合醫療資源，運用「科學」與「專業」來參與抗疫。「醫療病歷自動化系統」由臨床醫學研究中心主任劉秉彥帶領資訊工程師團隊，將過去一年來在精準醫療病歷自動化系統的經驗做一無縫接軌。
「胸部X光人工智慧判讀肺炎系統模型」為成大醫院影像醫學部醫師蔡依珊帶領醫院資訊團隊開發，電資學院孫永年教授團隊也積極參與，利用先前AI生技醫療創新研究中心計畫發展的肺結核X光片AI自動判讀模型，導入成大醫院的肺炎影像資料，雙方平行合作，以最快速度完成。
「溫心智慧手環」是在科技部前瞻司的支持下，由成大護理系主任柯乃熒、成大醫院副院長柯文謙、成大感染管制中心副主任陳柏齡、成大資訊工程學系副教授莊坤達、成大資訊工程學系主任高宏宇及成大數學系副教授舒宇宸，與科技公司共同研究開發。

Thinner, Faster and More Power-efficient
Intel Corp co-founder Gordon Moore developed Moore’s Law in 1965, which predicted that the number of Transistors on a chip would double every 18 to 24 months. It has since become a guiding principle in the computer chip industry. However, in the past few years, the physical transistor channel size limit has been reached, and the consequent challenges faced by the industry have given rise to questions as to whether the speed of innovation suggested by the law may have ended. Professor Chung-Lin Wu (Department of Physics) and Dr. Chia-Hao Chen have successfully extended and potentially laid the groundwork for going beyond Moore’s Law with a monolayer diode, which could lead to a breakthrough in the semiconductor industry. Their research published in Nature Communications, discusses the development of a 2D monolayer diode.

3,good-health-and-well-being,"Industry’s First Combination of Medicine and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Furthering AI Education","For the first time, NCKU Medical Center worked with the NCKU College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science to open novel courses. Under the leadership of NCKU president, Dr. Jenny Su, more than 10 NCKU Medical Center professors and doctors worked together to open a series of courses on “AI Applications and Services in Medical Treatment”. The courses will be available in the College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science by 2019 to help students systematically learn the new frontier of medical treatment.
The key to this new frontier of medical treatment is to discover new values of AI applications. We expect students to be more open to AI applications and extend their studies. This collaboration between the Center and the College is expected to enhance the training of talents with both backgrounds in engineering and medicine to spread the seed of Taiwan's AI medical technology and speed up the realization of intelligent medical treatment. AI Applications and Services in Medical Treatment is designed for the third year students of the college, and expects clinical doctors to mentor students with engineering design capabilities and engineering background. The goal is to interpret the medical revolution utilizing AI and discover the infinite possibilities of AI medical applications.
For example, cardiac surgeons will explain to students how to efficiently analyze electronic medical records, test data, gene pools and other Big data and develop them into clinical models to assist in diagnosis and treatment decisions. Medical imaging doctors will start with practical cases and explain how AI assists in reading medical images. Oncologists will talk about how to apply the massive gene data to clinical circumstances. Neurologists will explain how to use AI to diagnose complex neuropathies.
For many years NCKU Medical Center has been collaborating with domestic and overseas world-class Big data experts to study and apply AI for medical treatment. For example, in cardiovascular diseases, researchers study young patients with myocardial infarction due to an Asian-specific gene mutation. They combine blood biochemistry indicators to predict the outcome of cardiovascular diseases. In cancer precision medicine, NCKU has established a database of oral cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer samples for analytical platforms. Through AI-assisted biomedical analysis, NCKU can explore genovariation related to Taiwanese specific cancers, and establish a predictive model for assessing cancer re-occurrence to develop treatment strategies. In neurology, NCKU will utilize the support of AI computing to establish clinical indicators for rapid diagnosis of neuropathy caused by cancer chemical treatment. Researchers will combine this with gene exploration to analyze the relationship between genovariation and neuropathy in order to predict which patients are prone to specific types of neuropathy. NCKU's research experience in AI medical treatment and applications not only demonstrates AI application in Medicine, but also acts as the cornerstone of intelligent medical treatment.
The development of AI application in medical treatment requires talents with both backgrounds in medicine and engineering, and powerful hardware. NCKU is now working with NVidia, the world's leading developer of visual computing technology and GPU processors, to use super computers to perform advanced studies on AI-assisted medical treatment, including gene exploration, medical image reading, and medical image restructuring.

3,good-health-and-well-being,Establishing Taiwan’s Database of Epidermolysis Bullosa,"Hereditary epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a rare hereditary skin disease where the skin forms blisters due to friction or the exertion of external forces. At birth, EB patients suffer pain and blisters that are difficult to heal. Aside from the inconvenience of blisters, patients will suffer problems in other organ systems such as the respiratory and digestive systems. Severe patients will have an increase in the risk of mortality. According to overseas literature, out of a million newborn babies, approximately 20 are EB patients. In estimation, there are nearly 500 EB patients in Taiwan.
NCKU Hospital is a critical medical base with the capability to diagnose and treat EB patients. There are 14 publications related to EB patients in the medical literature database, 13 of which are contributed by the NCKU Medical Center. The genetic diagnosis and counseling are useful for prenatal examination to prevent the birth of severely inflicted EB patients. This research connects with overseas clinical trial results. However, due to the restrictions of conventional gene diagnosis methods and limited research resources, most of EB patients have not received an accurate gene diagnosis.
With support from the Rare Disease Prevention plan of Ministry of Health and Welfare, NCKU Medical Center set up a Skin Pathology & Gene Research Lab to aid 30 Taiwanese EB patients find the disease causing gene. In addition to patients transferred from other Taiwan hospitals, the center conducted genetic analysis for patients from Japan, the Philippines and Mexico.

3,good-health-and-well-being,Building Intelligent Hospitals for the Elderly,"On September 3, 2018, NCKU signed an MOU of Intelligent Medical Collaboration for the Elderly with Quanta Computer Inc., to utilize AI and IoT to co-develop patient-oriented medical treatment and care, and build a benchmark intelligent hospital for the elderly. NCKU Medical Center has an excellent medical work force, an exemplary domestic reputation in medical treatment, and abundant clinical experience. With the agreement signed by both sides, NCKU will provide an optimal place for medical clinical tests and offer assistance in medical research to help optimize Quanta Computer’s technology and products. With NCKU’s AI-assisted medical treatment, the disease-oriented treatment of the past will become a patient-oriented care system. The bilateral collaboration will bring mutual benefits and benefit a vast number of patients and their families.
One of the purposes of introducing AI into hospitals for the elderly is to help medical personnel improve medical care quality. Another focus is to build a barrier-free hospital. The top priority of the barrier-free hospital is to combine community pharmacists, community doctors, and public health nurses to construct a technology-driven community health care net that connects with post-discharge care to extend the hospital-based care system to the community. For example, patients with cardiac catheters, with complete intelligent medical treatment services, post-surgery patients will transmit biological data the entire day to the hospital via head-mounted wearables. Upon signal anomaly, the monitoring staff will immediately inform the patient and give advice. Additionally, with the community health care net, the community pharmacists will provide patients with the medicine, the community doctors will diagnose the patients, and the public health nurses will provide health education. The patients’ information including pharmaceutical records and medical records can be accessed from the cloud and transmitted to the information center of the hospital for the elderly to provide health management for the public and build a barrier-free hospital. AI will be utilized on hosptial wards. NCKU Hospital is currently working on intelligent wards. This will integrate independent pieces of information via technology and provide them to the patients, nurses and doctors. In an intelligent ward, patients will be able to understand the reasons for inspection, assess the risks of the treatment, know the time of the doctors’ ward check, ask doctors questions ahead of time, and even know post-surgery recovery status.
The enormous medical data generated from intelligent medical treatment services is the cornerstone of enhancing precision medical treatment. Through IA computing and analysis, NCKU provides the big data required to foster precision medical treatments including, preventive medicine, personalized medicine, participating medicine, and to establish patient-exclusive treatment strategies. NCKU Medical Center will utilize technology to map out holistic intelligent medical treatment services.
Founded in 1984, NCKU Hospital was one of Taiwan government's 14 major construction projects of the country. NCKU Hospital is a critical national medical center located in southern Taiwan with the purpose of balancing northern and southern medical treatment resources. NCKU is one of the few top comprehensive universities in Taiwan. From science and technology to Medicine, NCKU's intelligent hospital for the elderly integrates specialized talents training with the medical treatment industry and care system for the elderly. It is also a reference for the decision making of the government to foster policies for the elderly and intelligent long-distance medical treatment.

3,good-health-and-well-being,A Critical Medical Defense Against Dengue Fever in Southern Taiwan— the NCKU Medical Center,"NCKU Medical Center’s Research Findings
NCKU Hospital maintained its duty of guarding public health against multiple waves of dengue fever. NCKU Hospital is a wealth of clinical experience in dengue fever prevention, treatment and care. It joined forces with the dengue fever research team to continue devotion for clinical research and the study of dengue fever virus.
Let’s look at the research progression of NCKU Medical Center in the past decade from two books on dengue fever. The book on the left is Dengue Disease (ISBN 978-81-308-0290-9) written in 2008 by Professor Huan-Yao Lei from the Department of Microbiology & Immunology of NCKU. This was the first English textbook on dengue fever in Taiwan. The co-authors were Director Ching-Chuan Liu, Dr. Shih-Min Wang, and other experts. It represents the contribution by NCKU towards dengue fever research from 1996 to 2008. Furthermore, 11 articles in the dengue fever featured issue of American Journal of Infectious Disease (Jan. Issue) were contributed by the dengue fever research group of NCKU Medical Center. Subsequently, the group published six journals in the dengue fever featured issue of Journal of Biomedical Science in 2013, of which 5 articles were listed as highly accessed papers.
The book on the right is Taiwan Experience with Dengue Fever: From epidemiology and Clinical Treatment to the New Horizon of Basic Science (ISBN 978-986-04-8675-9) written by Yee-Shin Lin of the Department of Microbiology & Immunology. It was the first popular Chinese science book on dengue fever. The co-authors were Director Ching-Chuan Liu, Dr. Tzong-Shiann Ho, and others. The book simplifies the intricate illness state of dengue fever and the guidelines for handling. These were developed into a seven-word poem which, in literal translation, is “2 waves of fever in 6 days; The rash follows the endangering fever; Blood test within the first 5 days of virus infection; In dengue fever exists tricks to conquer it; Refrain from overdose of fluid transfusion; No blood transfusion unless it is necessary; The body fluid will be re-absorbed.”
In 2014, the group was invited to write an electronic textbook named “Dengue fever: transmission, diagnosis & surveillance”, edited by Jamie Whitehorn and Jeremy Farrar, Future Medicine Ltd. (ISBN: 978-1-78084-384-1). Chapter title: “Lessons learned from dengue – Focus on Taiwan”, which introduced Taiwan's experience to the world's related clinical personnel and research workers. In 2011, the Center of Infectious Disease and Signaling Research was founded and members include clinical and basic infectious disease experts from NCKU. In recent years the group formed a long-term collaboration with medical and research institutes in dengue-fever-afflicted Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka.
In 2017, the dengue fever research group of NCKU held a workshop of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, inviting dengue fever scholars from Southeast Asia to convene at NCKU. Through multi-lateral sharing of research findings, the workshop matched invited scholars with Taiwanese scholars for epidemiology, intensive care, pathogenesis, anti-virus medication and vaccine optimization to establish bilateral or multi-lateral collaboration. Southeast Asia Dengue Fever Research Institute was founded upon this concept to foster the establishment of Southeast Asia Dengue Fever Research Platform.
In the future the group will utilize the accumulated findings of fundamental research, the college’s and the world's perspectives, and continue the clinical study of dengue fever virus, fundamental research, and the R&D of vaccines and medications. By analyzing the epidemiology of dengue fever in Southern Taiwan, the group will improve the efficacy of medical care, actively cultivate new-generation talents with a passion for dengue fever research, and operate the Southeast Asia Dengue Fever Research Platform to provide prevention strategies and preparations against future dengue fever outbreaks.

3,good-health-and-well-being,Without passion there is no road to greatness!,"Dr. Natisha Dukhi receives the 2018 Gro Brundtland Week of Women in Sustainable Development from Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Tang Prize Foundation and NCUK President Huey-Jen Jenny Su at NCKU, April 3rd.
Endorsed by Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, granted by Tang Prize Foundation and organized by NCKU, the Gro Brundtland Week of Women in Sustainable Development commits to engage the outstanding female researchers for public health and sustainable development. It empowers an international platform for collaboration and partnership of female researchers in Taiwan and developing countries.
Dr. Dukhi is a Research Specialist at the Human Sciences Research Council in the Department of Population Health, Health Systems and Innovation of South Africa with expertise in Maternal, Adolescent and Child Health in South Africa and globally.
“This award gives me and my research a chance to be recognized at a local, national and international level,” says Dr. Dukhi. With gratitude to many people in her life and career, she particularly appreciates the support given by her mother. “My mother always made time for me and how I achieved my successes in my career. She has always made time to learn of my work and how to get me to achieve my goals. She is still to this day that pillar of strength that is continuously motivating and encouraging me to brace my science career, every day.”
Dr. Dukhi has spent over 12 years of experience in academia, lecturing Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology and Pathophysiology at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban University of Technology and Rhodes University. She is also currently an Executive Board of Directors for the Public Health Association of South Africa (PHASA), a Board member for the “World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology: Scientific and Technical Committee & Editorial Review”, and a member of the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World, and International Union for Health Promotion and Education (IUHPE).
Her research topic is “the effectiveness of diet and physical activity interventions conducted in schools in preventing overweight and obesity in children and adolescents: the iLembe School Physical Activity and Nutrition (i-SPAN) study”. The study began in 2017 with stakeholder meetings with members of the Departments of Health, Basic Education and Sports & Recreation. A steering committee was also established. In the first phase, an elicitation research will be conducted to ascertain the extent of health promotion within the school environment, followed by the next phase of nutrition and physical activity intervention.
Children overweight and obesity in South African children is in a critical condition of 13% national prevalence, compared to 6.1% as the global average. This study has the potential to expand to more districts in KwaZulu-Natal province, to become part of the Departments of Health and Education Health Promoting Programme and contribute to the community and district/national policies regarding childhood obesity.
As South Africa expands its health focus from infection diseases to lifestyle related conditions, such as overweight and obesity, Dr. Dukhi expects more health surveys will be conducted at regional and national level, to facilitate science researches and increase public awareness.
She is also involved in the Teen MomConnect Program which was initiated in 2016, to contribute to reduce the risk factor prevalence in pregnant teenagers and their maternal mortality rate from the four leading conditions, including hypertension, non-pregnancy related infections (e.g. HIV/AIDS related, TB or pneumonia), obstetric haemorrhage and medical and surgical disorders). The elicitation research findings will be used to inform the design of Motivational Interviewing (MI) intervention content and structure as well as enhance the original MomConnect messages to be more cognitively and culturally appropriate for teenage pregnant girls.
The study is a collaborative partnership for the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) with Praekelt Foundation (JHB, SA), Michigan University (USA), and National and Provincial Department of Health (WC). “Working within a research environment such as HSRC, affords me the opportunity to be involved at the grass root level of community research that can inform policy, says Dr. Dukhi. However, she points out that South Africa follows a two-tier healthcare system, which is not accessible or equitable to majority of the population, but also observes the government is responding to the restructure and revitalization of the healthcare system.
Having overcome many challenges in her science career, Dr. Dukhi says, “I believe you always encounter situations, frustrations, and setbacks irrespective of where you can be situated. But, having lived and trained in South Africa, I have to say that women researchers are still short changed in the workplace and the outside environment. I have encountered racism, lack of support, on my journey to becoming a doctor but I have always overcome them.”
“I think there is no fixed and fast way to overcoming shortfalls. You have to deal with situations head on, remembering to maintain class and decorum, not just as a woman but also as a human being. Sometimes silence is golden and at other moments you have to have a voice that needs to be heard.”
“South Africa is still undergoing transition in various aspects, and so as an Indian female researcher, I have to constantly prove my worth and that of my research or face being compared to other race groups or being told I am too young. I have dealt with this by letting my research speak for itself, motivating others where I can, sharing the knowledge I possess and simply enjoying what I do,” concludes Dr. Dukhi.
2018年Gro Brundtland Award得主，來自南非的Natisha Dukhi博士，目前在南非人類發展委員會族群健康、健康照護系統及創新部門擔任研究專員，她的研究著重於全球與南非地區的孕產婦、青少年與兒童健康。現正執行預防兒童和青少年過重與肥胖的健康生活研究計畫，要將健康促進引入校園，推動健康體適能與均衡飲食，預防南非兒童過重與肥胖問題。
過去20年來，兒童肥胖已經成為發展中國家和開發國家的共同問題，在南非孩童過重與肥胖也是一大問題，南非兒童的過胖率為13%，較全球平均水準6.1％高出2倍。
Dr. Dukhi2017年於南非夸祖魯-納塔爾（KZN）省的iLembe區，執行一項在學校預防兒童和青少年過重與肥胖方面的健康生活研究（i-SPAN），該研究由衛生部、基礎教育、體育等部門成立委員會來支持，是一項新的綜合混合方法／隨機對照試驗設計，包括飲食、體身活動、學校與家庭介入措施。要透過家長、學校教師一起來推動孩童飲食均衡等健康生活，以預防兒童及青少年肥胖。該計畫已獲得肯定，未來將擴大到其他地區實行，做為KZN兒童肥胖預防和管理的一部份，甚至進而成為衛生和教育衛生部門健康促進計畫的一部份，對社區、國家兒童肥胖政策產生貢獻。
另外，Dr. Dukhi也參與了執行中的Teen Mom Connect研究，是南非第一個對青少女懷孕的相關研究，該項研究將科技與手機結合，針對參與研究的懷孕青少女，發布相關的醫療、衛生等訊息以及問卷測試，以強化懷孕少女以及兒童的健康照護，目標在降低高血壓，非妊娠相關感染，愛滋病毒與愛滋病相關的結核病或肺炎、產科出血以及內外科疾病等。研究結果若能證明有效，將有助於降低懷孕青少女的罹病危險因素和孕婦死亡率。
獲得Gro Brundtland Award，Dr. Dukhi深以為榮。她欣喜的說，得獎不僅僅是榮譽，更重要的是傳遞出對女性研究員的尊重與讚賞。「這個獎項，讓我和我的研究，得到國內外的注意與認同」。回首來時路，Dr. Dukhi指出，自己能有今天的成績，最要感謝的是媽媽，「雖然媽媽不曾受過教育，但她卻教我積極面對人生、擁抱事業，總是花時間盡量去了解我的工作，也不斷激勵和鼓勵我向前邁進，是我最大的支柱，幫助我實現目標。」
Dr. Dukhi接受高等教育，擁有博士學位，但她也不諱言，一路走來有不少挫折、沮喪，甚至不受尊重的待遇，「目前來說，南非女性研究人員不論在工作場所和其他的環境，仍受到不公平對待，她也一直在克服，這是必需面對的現狀，俗話說『沈默是金』，但有時候必須積極發聲，讓別人聽到自己的意見。」
Dr. Dukhi表示，長期以來，她得不斷去證明自己以及研究上的價值，即使常被告知太年輕，或是與其他種族相比較，但她總是以研究成績來為自己說話或證明，並盡可能以自身的經驗去鼓勵他人，與他人分享自己的研究成績。
對於有心投入科學領域的女性，Dr. Dukhi以「勇往直前」這句話來給予鼓勵！「我認為，成功達成目標是沒有極限的，女孩們，努力工作，享受付出，但也別忘了享受生活。」

3,good-health-and-well-being,"Be exceptional at what you do, and your gender will not matter….","Dr. Barbara Burmen receives the 2018 Gro Brundtland Week of Women in Sustainable Development from Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Tang Prize Foundation and NCUK President Huey-Jen Jenny Su at NCKU, April 3rd.
Endorsed by Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, granted by Tang Prize Foundation and organized by NCKU, the Gro Brundtland Week of Women in Sustainable Development commits to engage outstanding female researchers working in the field public health and sustainable development. It facilitates the creation of an international platform for collaboration and partnership between female researchers from Taiwan and female researchers from developing countries.
Dr. Burmen’s recognition is attributed to her accomplishments as a medical doctor and a public health specialist in the field of HIV and TB implementation Science at the Kenya Medical Research Institute Center for Global Health Research. The 2018 Gro Brundtland award is an important impetus for for Dr. Burmen to continue her research into enhancing population health and promoting sustainable health systems through operations research.
Dr Burmen’s current research focuses on the utility of Tuberculosis (TB) household contact investigation as a means to control childhood TB in a high TB burden densely populated region. Her research showed that nearly 80% of TB index cases had at least one household contact, and 23% of them were child contacts. The TB index child contact ratio was 1: 0.62. Latent TB infection (LTBI) as evidenced by a positive Tuberculin skin test was diagnosed in 43% of children and TB disease in 2% of children. The results fully support the recommended guidelines of providing TB prevention using isoniazid chemoprophylaxis to all child contacts who do not have TB.
This research also highlighted the issues that would need to be considered by TB programs when transitioning from a setting with routine TB household contact invitation to standardized TB household contact investigation and proposed sustainable methods to aide in this transition; a topic she would address symposium speaker.
Her prior research has focused on screening for TB in HIV, the use of cough monitors to increase TB detection within a health facility and screening for HIV in hospital and non-hospital settings.
Annual TB mortality in a PLWHA is ten times that in HIV negative individuals in their lifetime. Newly diagnosed PLHIV would benefit from TB screening and timely TB diagnosis. The initiation of Tuberculosis prevention therapy with Isoniazid will also reduce their risk for developing TB. We implemented an evidence-based approach to TB screening in 15 HIV care and treatment clinics in the Nyanza Province of Kenya, that led to the timely identification of 11% (81/779) of PLHIV with TB who were initiated on TB treatment and had favorable treatment outcomes. The use of lay persons (cough monitors) to improve TB case finding in community settings contributed to 33% of annual TB case burden.
Furthermore, access to voluntary counseling and testing services for HIV provided through research and programmatic settings run by our unit led to the timely identification of PLHIV who can receive ART to either decrease their risk of TB infection if they do not have concurrent TB infection or improve their TB treatment outcomes if they have TB coinfection respectively.
In 2013, Dr. Burmen facilitated the launch of an “Express Nursing Desk” in at a busy HIV clinic that facilitated the delivery of a monthly ART prescription after a nurse’s review if deemed “clinically stable”, and successfully reduced patient waiting time. This supported clinic operations as it had only 60% of its staffing requirements. This was incepted approximately 5 years’ before the inception of “Differentiated care model” (DCM) by the WHO that recommended different levels of services for different patients to alleviate the burden on the health system.
Dr. Burmen believes that women bring their unique perspective to science, which differs from that of males, and this leads to an increase in the range of inventions and breakthroughs. “Whatever problem is prioritized and solutions generated to address, it will depend on the gender of the scientists at that time.”
When women are involved in science, research is more likely to address problems related to women’s health and welfare and solutions generated are more likely to be gender inclusive. Subsequently, women are likely to receive better quality health care. Similar results have been observed where there are women in leadership positions. Women are also more socially aware than men and foster more ""communal"" qualities (good communal relations and inclusive environments), which can yield ""immensely positive"" results in scientific research.
“We also live in a society where there are are now some female role models to not only look up to, but to also approach for mentorship,”, commented Dr. Burmen. “Each application you make is an opportunity to reflect on your career path and sharpen your skills to make the next (and maybe successful) application.
“My advices for the other female scientists are: to develop a supportive network both at work and at home; to be willing to ask for and accept help both at home and in the workplace; to find time to mentor others and always know in the back of your mind that you are an inspiration to other women (and men alike) who are known or unknown to you. Above all, be exceptional at what you do, and your gender will not matter!”
來自肯亞的Barbara Burmen，目前正攻讀公共衛生博士學位，是肯亞醫學研究院的資深研究員，帶領團隊從事愛滋病毒與肺結核病毒研究。獲得2018 Gro Brundtland Award，Dr. Burmen說，Gro Brundtland博士是響譽國際的公共衛生專家，台灣又是致力於永續發展的國家，能在眾多提名者中獲獎，是極大的榮幸。這個獎不僅提高專業上的認可，也強化了個人聲譽，期待這個獎帶來更多的研究能量，也成為她繼續投入健康照護系統、公共衛生研究的重大動力。
Dr. Burmen目前的研究集中於結核病（TB）家庭接觸者調查，希望能夠用來控制結核病高負擔人口密集地區童年結核病，研究發現近80％的結核病指數病例至少有一次家庭接觸，其中23％是兒童接觸。
Dr. Burmen表示，肯亞結核病新病例，大多是病患出現症狀求診才發現，而最新的結核病流行率調查，約40%的結核病患者未被診斷出。為此，她曾小規模在社區調查與研究，結核病患者的家戶日常生活情形，並設計多種篩檢與預防治療模式，在結核病病例密集區針對兒童進行，降低兒童羅患潛伏型結核病轉為確定病例的比例。
2010年起，肯亞透過愛滋篩檢、社區咳嗽監測、結核指數病例來找尋新結核病例，Dr. Burmen也加入愛滋與結核病的研究，她與團隊在肯亞Nyanza省的15個愛滋病診所進行結核病篩檢，及時讓11%的結核病感染者接受治療。另外，她在愛滋病診所也觀察到，病人花了很多時間等待，於是引入快速「護理台」服務，針對病情穩定者提供快速複查、領取處方藥服務，以減少等待時間。
Dr. Burmen認為，女性科學家不論身處哪個國家，都面臨很多挑戰，原因之一是性別定型觀念及性別規範，同時升遷經常被忽略。在肯亞，大家仍常發現，工作場所中因性別帶來的壓力與困擾，與上一代沒有差太多。「本身有家庭子女的女科學家更是辛苦，等於有兩份全職工作，一是8到12小時的上班時間，另一個是24小時的母親角色，加起來科學家媽媽的工作等於約42小時。」
Dr. Burmen說，目前女性在科學、技術、工程、數學這些領域仍屬少數，但仍不乏優秀女性學者專家為榜樣，鼓勵年輕女性學子勇敢跟進與跨入。Dr. Burmen強調，女性投入科學研究對社會是正面的，女性特有的觀察力與細密心思與男性大不相同，有女性參與研究能夠帶來更多的突破並擴大研究的範圍。此外，女性的社會意識與包容性也較男性強，女性的許多特質能夠產出積極正面的科學研究成果，也更能解決與婦女健康和福祉有關的問題，帶來更好的優質醫療保健。
Dr. Burmen鼓勵有心投入科學領域的年輕女性學子，在生活、職場、科學領域上有許多挑戰，女性要在工作和家庭之間取得平衡，一定要建立一個支持性的網絡，遇到挑戰要積極尋求並接受幫助，也盡可能去指導他人，「我們的所做所為都可能對他人產生啟發或鼓勵，更要記住，我們所做的事，無關乎性別。」

3,good-health-and-well-being,NCKU Alumnus Dr. Paul Bosawai Popora Opens First Standard Clinic in the Solomon Islands,"Located 5,000 kilometers away from Taiwan, the Solomon Islands is one of Taiwan’s few diplomatic allies. The 35-year-long exclusive friendship between both island nations is embodied in Dr. Paul Bosawai Popora, a graduate of National Cheng Kung University’s （NCKU） College of Medicine. After receiving his bachelor’s degree in July 2014, Popora returned to his home in the Solomon Islands to serve as the country’s sole professionally trained doctor. In 2017, Popora took the first step towards realizing his dream vocation by starting his own clinical practice.
Dr. Popora’s clinic is located on Guadalcanal, the principal island of the Solomon, and is the first standard medical building in the country. The building was built by civil engineering high school students who, under the guidance of Dr. Popora and the assistance of textbooks on architectural design, completed the construction within two years. Dr. Popora hopes that one day he can build a hospital replete with various medical departments, including emergency rooms, general surgery, gynecology, obstetrics, and pediatrics. It is hope that these resources would benefit the community by improving the quality of medical treatment. Dr. Popora’s hopes and aspirations for the betterment of his community all started with his study at National Cheng Kung University.
The path to success is strewn with obstacles: “The only thing you must not do is give up!”
In 2004, Popora received a scholarship from the Taiwanese government and arrived in Taiwan to begin his studies, which required that he first learn Mandarin Chinese. Initially, the language was completely alien to him. Coupled with an intense case of homesickness, Popora wanted to return home immediately. However, after struggling through eight difficult months, he was ultimately admitted into National Cheng Kung University’s College of Medicine in 2005. His first year was a trying one. The issues he had in his classes were mounting. He was ready to throw in the towel, and wrote to the college dean Ruey-Jen Sung: “I give up. I want to go home.”
Dean Sung immediately called Popora in to talk to him face to face to try to dissuade him from leaving: “The only thing you must not do is give up!”. With dean’s encouragement, Popora was able to adjust his mindset. Setting his eyes on his goal of becoming a doctor, Popora forged ahead and faced all sorts of challenges head-on.
During his internship at NCKU Hospital, Popora became determined to reach his goal:
“When I was working at NCKU Hospital, I witnessed many doctors, nurses, and volunteers’ selfless efforts and contributions. I knew I had to bring this medical technology back to my country.” Initially, patients were unaccustomed to his skin color and accented Chinese, but they were moved after witnessing Popora’s diligence and commitment. Popora left a deep impression on Ming-Fei Liu, a physician in the hospital’s department of internal medicine: “Popora was always open to engaging in discussions with others and learning from those exchanges. Moreover, the medical records he recorded were detailed and substantial. He was also kind towards his patients and received praise from all around.”
Moved by the acts of selflessness within the NCKU Hospital, Popora sets his heart on becoming a doctor
In July 2014, Popora received his bachelor’s degree from NCKU’s College of Medicine. In the following month, Dr. Popora returned to his country to work at a clinic at GPPOL, the company that sponsored his studies in Taiwan. At GPPOL’s clinic, he treated 2,500 patients free of charge on a monthly basis. Due to the grossly underdeveloped healthcare industry in the Solomon Islands, Dr. Popora was the island’s sole physician, so he had to see patients across all departments in the clinic. This was reminiscent of his internship days in the NCKU Hospital. Nevertheless, Dr. Popora was spurred by his experiences working at the NCKU Hospital and began promoting a volunteer program that centered on bettering the community through community development, healthcare, and education.
In order to stimulate community development, Dr. Popora pushed for a community revenue plan where 10% of the revenue would go into a community improvement fund. He donated half of his salary into to fund a village development project of improving the community’s water source. Dr. Popora continued to offer his medical services at the Good Samaritan Hospital which had no physician. In addition, he would go to the Ghaobata Community Elementary School every Sunday to teach mathematics to the students there, hoping that these efforts would help students continue their studies.
Four years after returning home, Dr. Popora maintains close contact with his NCKU teachers and classmates. He says that he has never once forgotten about his experiences in Taiwan, and is immensely grateful to his professors, advisors, and the workers at the NCKU Hospital. Dr. Popora hopes that he can one day return to his alma mater and continue his studies in external medicine. “You must remember that I am also an NCKU ambassador in the Solomon Islands.”
距離台灣 5000 多公里，位於澳洲東北方的索羅門群島，是台灣少數邦交國之一，兩個島國建交35年的特殊情誼，也在成功大學留下美好的印記。2014 年 7 月，來自索羅門的波波拉（Paul Bosawai Popora）從成大獲得醫學學位，隨即返回家鄉成為當地唯一的醫生。2017 年波波拉醫師在家鄉建造了自己的診所，為他的醫療志業夢邁出重大一步。
高中畢業的波波拉，2004 年飄洋過海到達台灣，進入成功大學醫學系就讀，展開他 10 年間波折不斷的求學生涯。返鄉後，波波拉醫師每個月義務免費看診 2500 人次，他將台灣視為他第二個故鄉，同時感念成大讓他實現幫助當地民眾的醫療志願，自稱「將永遠是成大在索羅門群島的大使」。
醫生開設自己的診所看似稀鬆平常，但在索羅門群島偏遠的瓜達康納爾島，波波拉的診所是當地第一棟正規醫療建築，而這還是波波拉自己參考建築教科書、畫設計圖、購買建材，讓學木工的高中生花了兩年時間蓋好的。 這非凡的成就讓波波拉的同學現任東海大學助理教授的 Timothy McBush Hiele 忍不住特地傳訊向成大校長蘇慧貞報喜。波波拉的最終夢想是建造一家更大更專業的醫院，希望設有診療室、外科、婦產科、兒科、急診室及5間病房，提供給家鄉地區居民良好的醫療品質。這個醫療志業夢起源於成大。
求學生涯波折不斷　「你唯一要做的事，就是不要放棄！」
2003年波波拉曾因政府獎學金於巴布亞紐幾內亞修讀醫學，但一年不到就沒了經費被迫輟學，第二年波波拉幸運地獲得台灣政府提供的獎學金，於是飛到台灣繼續學業。第一次出國的波波拉，在新加坡轉機時目瞪口呆地看著高樓大廈，搭飛機時，心裡一直認為自己搭的是「空中火車」，想到火車竟然能夠在空中行走還能精確地被操控到某個地方，讓他驚嚇不已。
但更大的衝擊還在後頭，波波拉被要求先學習中文，對他來說完全是天書，加上嚴重的思鄉病，幾乎馬上想回家，但為了未來的學業挑戰，終於撐過8個月的努力。緊接而來的是更艱巨的挑戰，2005 年波波拉錄取成大醫學系，第一年就吃盡苦頭，再怎麼努力，學業上還是有太多的疑惑難解。某天他真的覺得自己撐不下去了，心灰意冷之餘，寫信給當時的宋瑞珍院長說：「我想放棄回鄉去！」
宋瑞珍院長當時立刻打電話給波波拉找他面談，用堅定的語氣告訴他：「你在這裡唯一要做的一件事，就是不要放棄！」受到院長鼓舞，波波拉重新調整心情，堅強迎接各種挑戰，日復一日，也正因為院長的一席話，原本想要成為工程師的波波拉努力朝向成為醫生的路邁進。
但挫折又再次襲來，大四那年，他的台灣獎學金提供到期了，面臨輟學的波波拉難過地打電話通知遠在家鄉的哥哥，因為沒錢不能再唸書，即將返家。但天無絕人之路，正在宿舍收拾行李的波波拉接到索羅門大使致電，詢問他學習狀況，再次幫他爭取到兩年獎學金繼續學業，在學最後1年，波波拉又想辦法找贊助者，索羅門的GPPOL棕櫚油公司以他畢業後任職公司診所為條件答應贊助，波波拉總算能夠安心完成學業。
在醫院實習階段，波波拉奠定了成為醫師的畢生志願，「當時在成大醫院我看到許多醫師、護理人員及志工無私的付出與奉獻，我更堅定要把醫術帶回故鄉的想法。」其實一開始，病人對於膚色黝黑、中文腔調特別的波波拉不太習慣，但後來都被他認真又負責的態度所感動。成大醫院內科醫師劉明輝印象深刻，「波波拉樂於和大家討論並且從中學習，病歷紀錄做得很詳實，對病人很親切，頗受好評。」
奠定醫師畢生志願　成大醫院無私付出與奉獻感動了他
2014年7月，波波拉取得成功大學醫學學位，8月份便返回家鄉在GPPOL公司的診所工作。當時，要離開生活了10年的台灣，對波波拉來說並不是件容易的事，他說自己當時很捨不得離開，因為在台灣、在成大，學習到很多，也獲得很多，而且擁有很多朋友，台灣是他的第二個故鄉。
所羅門醫療落後，GPPOL 公司的診所提供當地民眾免費醫療 而波波拉是唯一的醫生，什麼科都要看，與在成大醫院實習相比，有過之而猶不及，每個月平均看診2500人。因為在成大醫院深受感動，看診之餘，波波拉也在家鄉號召並推動志工服務工作，以社區發展、醫療及教育等模式幫助及服務家鄉社區民眾。 在社區發展方面，波波拉推動社區營收計畫，計畫所得的 10% 捐入社區基金，他自己個人則捐出一半薪水當作資金，透過鄉村發展計畫，完成水源改善；醫療志工方面，當另一家 Good Samaritan 醫院沒有醫生時，他就義務免費幫忙看診；而教育志工方面，他每周日都在 Ghaobata 社區中學免費教授數學，幫助學生順利升上高中。
將在成大醫學院所學的均化為志工服務的養份，波波拉一人身兼多職，除了擔任 GPPOL 健康部門主任之外，包括 GPPOL 瓜達爾卡納爾島工會主席、鄉村發展計畫志工、Ghaobata社區中學數理志工老師、Komubety 及 Sape 社區營收計畫與發展顧問、瓜達爾卡納爾島省 Thimbo 部落 Luvumatanighabu 主席、Good Samaritan 醫院醫生志工以及 Sape 醫療中心主任，都是義務幫忙。
從成大醫學系畢業回到家鄉所羅門群島已近 4 年，波波拉仍然和許多成大的教授、同學們保持密切聯繫，曾任醫學院院長的林其和教授表示，波波拉求學期間，挑戰很多，但他始終以無比毅力去克服難關，所以回到家鄉有這麼出眾的表現是意料之中，「也許有朝一日有機會成為所羅門群的衛生部長，為更多人謀福利。」雖然在離台灣遙遠故鄉努力看診和做志工，但波波拉說，他從沒忘記在台灣的一切，也非常感謝教授和導師們，以及成大醫院醫療訓練的工作人員，有朝一日他希望能夠有機會再回到母校進修外科醫療，「別忘了我會一直是成大在索羅門群島的大使。」

3,good-health-and-well-being,AI Biotech and Medical Innovation Research Center in NCKU,"The launch of the AI biotech and medical innovation research center by National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) on February 12, 2018 declares a new epoch, ushering in the advent of artificial intelligence technologies and medical innovation research and industrialization in Tainan. AI achievements attained by long-term collaborative endeavors by College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), College of Engineering, College of Medicine, and College of Bioscience & Biotechnology were all exhibited at the venue, including an automated carer and companion for diabetes patients, smart fitness equipment that accommodates the specific needs of elderly residents in community homes, and interactive virtual reality technology that enables long-distance care.
The automated carer is capable of simulating human speech. Prof. Jung-Hsien Chiang at EECS explained that while the robot was assembled by ready-made components, all programs, such as speech recognition, text-to-speech (TTS), action control, and question response, were developed by NCKU. The robot looked a little uneasy when he was asked by the announcer to say hello to the audience, and then burst out, “I’m so nervous seeing a lot of people here.” When asked about how he felt about the weather during the Chinese New Year holiday, he gave a prompt answer. He even wore a pensive expression while he formulated his reply, which delighted the audience. More importantly, this robot is capable of providing medical information and other essential services to diabetes patients. Further functionality regarding care provision for the elderly is planned for future upgrades.
The screen attached to the smart fitness equipment is designed for elderly users. This interface helps control the speed and force exerted by users. The user’s heart rate or calories consumed in the use of the machine is shown on the screen and uploaded for sharing with medical staff via the cloud.
Virtual interactive presence (VIP) employs interactive virtual reality technology to enable medical staff to interact with patients participating in training sessions at NCKU hospital and keep updated on their health status. A highlight of the launch was the demonstration of instantaneous interpretation of two languages by AI. When the announcer greeted the audience in Chinese, it was immediately broadcast in Taiwanese Hokkien, which was a real crowd-pleaser. The research team at Tokyo Metropolitan University, who have collaborated in NCKU’s efforts in care provision of the elderly, expressed their good wishes in a live video-stream, in which they spoke in Japanese. Their wishes were broadcast in Chinese. This technology is also capable of translating from Chinese to Japanese.
The AI biotech and medical innovation research center founded at NCKU is the only center to date that has combined AI technology and biotech innovations in southern Taiwan. The president of NCKU, Huey-Jen Su, Deputy Minister of Ministry of Science and Technology, Fong-Chin Su, director of the Dept. of Information and Technology Education, Ministry of Education, Pau-Choo Chung, commissioner of the Southern Taiwan Science Park Bureau, Wei-cheng Lin; deputy mayor of Tainan City, Chung-Rung Wu, jointly participated in this opening ceremony. Venue design focused on showcasing the latest in technological innovation for patient care. Aside from demonstrations for the latest discoveries and applications related to long-term care, there were several displays detailing a wide variety of research developments in AI biomedical development, including in-depth learning and human-computer interaction, and early discoveries of Alzheimer’s disease.
As Huey-Jen Su pointed out, the foundation of the AI biotech and medical innovation research center opens up infinite possibilities for the university. NCKU has achieved a careful balance between localization and globalization by paying due attention to the rising needs of urban dwellers in Taiwan and simultaneously creating new opportunities with international partners. Fong-Chin Su emphasized that the Ministry of Science and Technology will spare no effort in the arena of digital medicine and AI in the years to come. With its long-standing commitment to AI, he believes that NCKU has held pace with the rest of the world in medical and biotech fields.
The Office of Research and Development director, Sun-Yuan Hsieh, pointed out the launch of this center will go a long way in further applying AI technologies to medical treatment and long-term care, as well as establishing the medical-device and biotech industries in southern Taiwan. NCKU is wholeheartedly committed to its establishment as a bellwether in AI development. Large amounts of funding have been invested in the AIS & D Center responsible for AI development across the campuses of NCKU. The AIS & D Center will work closely with the AI biotech and medical innovation research center, so as to achieve their goal of expansion of the horizon of artificial intelligence in southern Taiwan.
成大「科技部人工智慧（AI）生技醫療創新研究中心」2 月 12 日盛大揭牌，正式宣告啟動人工智慧技術與醫療創新研究及產業化，現場展示成大多年來整合電資學院、工學院、醫學院、生科學院等跨領域 AI 合作成果，包括社區高齡照護健康促進的智慧運動器材、遠距社區照顧互動實境、陪伴與照顧糖尿病患功能的機器人等研究成果。
科技部次長蘇芳慶當場體驗智慧運動器材，他快速踩踏運動器材，結果螢幕上追著汽車跑的小狗因為速度太快差點撞上汽車，蘇芳慶趕緊放緩速度，太慢的小狗又差點被後方車輛追上，蘇慧貞校長半開玩笑上前提醒要他依照訓練節奏進行，小狗終於與前後汽車保持安全距離。這有趣好玩的畫面，讓長輩接受運動訓練時不覺得無聊，提升運動效果，也能控制速度與力量。運動者的心跳速率、消耗的卡路里會即時在螢幕上顯示，同時立即上傳雲端傳給遠端的醫療人員或復健師。
蘇慧貞校長對於會回答問題的陪伴照顧機器人大感興趣，仔細聆聽主持人介紹並進行互動對話。成大資訊系教授蔣榮先表示，機器人硬體來自現成品，重要的語音辨識、語音合成、行動控制、回應問題等軟體，都是成大研發。機器人應主持人要求，問候現場來賓時，還會出現害羞表情，回答說「人好多我好緊張」。面對詢問過年天氣如何，回答得中規中矩外也無秒差，有時還有轉動眼睛思考的表情，逗趣又可愛。更重要的是機器人會提醒用藥與用藥安全等，目前提供的是糖尿病患相關照顧資訊與服務，日後將再陸續增加銀髮族常見疾病照顧資訊。
遠距社區照顧互動實境，除了連線看到在成大醫院接受運動訓練的病友運動情形及身體資訊外，最引人注意的莫過於AI語音「翻譯」的展現，現場以國語向醫院病友問候，可立即轉換為台語，令在場者大感驚奇。與成大合作高齡照顧研究的日本東京首都大學團隊，特別視訊直播祝賀成大「科技部人工智慧生技醫療創新研發中心」揭牌，團隊以日語祝賀，台灣端聽到的則是國語，即席呈現雙方在日翻中的研發成果。
成大「科技部人工智慧生技醫療創新研究中心」，是新竹以南唯一的據點，蘇慧貞校長、科技部次長蘇芳慶、教育部資訊及科技教授司司長詹寶珠、南科管理局長林威呈、台南市副市長吳宗榮共同為中心揭牌，內外布置展示充滿未來科技感，除了現場演示長照相關的研發與應用外，也以海報方式展示AI其他生醫研究成果，包括深度學習與人及機器的互動對阿茲海默的早期發現等。
蘇慧貞指出，成大「科技部人工智慧生技醫療創新研究中心」成立，顯示的是成大在既有基礎下跨域發展AI生醫的無限可能，在地化以及國際化是成大核心，成大不只關注城市族群的需要，也要與國際共創產業新機會。
蘇芳慶表示，數位醫療、人工智慧是科技部推動的重點，成大發展AI多年，相信在成大在醫學、生醫基礎上，將可與世界並駕齊驅。 成大研發長謝孫源指出，科技部AI生醫創新研究中心的成立，對南台灣深化 AI 技術應用於醫療照護、前瞻醫材與生醫產業具有指標性的意義。
成大全力打造成大為AI發展之重鎮，已斥資打造支援全校AI研發的AI服務暨數據中心（AIS & D Center），此中心將與科技部AI生醫創新研究中心密切合作，讓成大及南台灣人工智慧研究版圖更為完整。

4,quality-education,NCKU BOOKS–ONE CITY Mobile Library Course: A Practical Interdisciplinary Course on General Education and Service Learning,"The National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) Library has employed exploratory innovation to design new general education courses including the NCKU BOOKS–ONE CITY Mobile Library course (hereafter “Mobile Library course”). On November 20, 2019 during the NCKU’s anniversary celebration, 20 teams of students and teachers departed from the university in 20 library-themed vans to travel to 20 administrative districts in Tainan. By integrating library resources and courses on innovation and narration, specific theme designs and displays were employed to impart knowledge to Tainan citizens. Students who take the Mobile Library course can learn about local cultures. Through the learning exchange of NCKU students and teachers with local communities, NCKU’s social responsibilities are implemented.
During the first academic semester of 2019, the NCKU Library collaborated with the Center for General Education and the Office of Academic Affairs to establish the Mobile Library course. This course encompasses general education and service learning courses. Professor Han-Ching Wang of the Department of Biotechnology and Bioindustry Sciences, who also serves as the University librarian, noted that in addition to implementing university social responsibilities, the course ventures beyond the library and campus boundaries, transcends geographical borders, and enables interaction with social communities. Furthermore, the course provides NCKU students who intend to conduct interdisciplinary learning with more course selection options.

The Mobile Library course offers a chance to share NCKU’s library resources with Tainan City. Wang stated that the library boasts an abundant collection of literature—more than 3.2 million items at the time of writing. In addition to holding events to attract NCKU students and teachers and Tainan citizens, the NCKU Library can venture out of the library and campus boundaries to actively influence Tainan City. Through this process, students who take the Mobile Library course can comprehend and practically experience the local cultural features of Tainan City.
Moreover, the Mobile Library course includes ample service learning themes. Executive Vice President Chun-Yen Chang stated, “I am, in fact, unfamiliar with most of these themes. By participating in this course, I would be able to learn many things.” The service learning themes include the biodiversity of hot spring environments, mature lifestyle industries, holistic, physiological, and psychological health in the lifestyles of health and sustainability, plant technology for sustainable agriculture, climate change and adaptation, multipopulation social lifestyles and historical culture, scientific thinking, the Magic of Light, and the diversity of crystalline materials. The mobile library route to Tainan Municipal Shiaying Junior High School, which was led by Professor Shih-Chen Shi of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, enabled students from the Czech Republic to share stories related to mechanical and photoelectric technology development in the Czech Republic using English.
Wang revealed that planning for the mobile library pilot service began in February 2019. After half a year of preparation, 20 teachers (including two foreign teachers) from different colleges of NCKU and its library were mobilized to lead 15 student groups in conducting creative thinking and planning the learning themes. More than 100 books from the NCKU Library were selected and loaded onto 15 medium-sized vans to serve as mobile libraries. The 15 student groups, passionate about knowledge sharing, traveled across Northern and Southern Taiwan, crossed mountain areas, and provided service learning for 15 administrative districts in Tainan City, including Nanxi, Nanhua, Longxi, Zuozhen, Xinying, Xiaying, Baihe, and Qigu Districts.
Finally, the Mobile Library course includes collaboration with a variety of social institutions, namely elementary schools, junior high schools, the Anping Rehabilitation Home, the Jacana Ecological Education Park, the Book Site and Xinying Citizen Classroom, and the Gong-guan Community. The mobile library assigned to Anping District, which was led by Professor Hsin-Ping Hsu of the Department of Psychology, adopted the theme of the holistic, physiological, and psychological health in the lifestyles of health and sustainability. For participants in Anping District who have weakened extremities due to long-term use of rehabilitation medication, Hsu’s team designed interactive tabletop games that focused on agile hand movements, namely Jenga with paper cups and Dixit—a card game. By communicating with the communities, sympathizing with community residents, identifying and resolving their problems, and establishing an interactive relationship, Hsu led students to thoroughly understand the history, culture, and social changes experienced by Tainan City. Through the Mobile Library course, NCKU fulfilled its university social responsibilities and the sustainable development goals promoted by the United Nations. On November 20, 2019, the Director of the General Education Center, Ming-Derg Lai, personally participated in a mobile library event held in Anping District. Through a Facebook check-in post, the Director expressed pleasure seeing that the NCKU Library continues to develop and create different roles and values.

4,quality-education,Taiwan NCKU Top 2 university in Asia in THE University Impact Ranking,"The Times Higher Education (THE) magazine on Thursday (April 22) released the Impact Rankings 2020, and two Taiwanese universities were on the list, with National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) at 38th in the world and 2nd in Asia, a new record high for Taiwanese schools in the world's four major ranking agencies.

NCKU President Dr. Huey-Jen Su (蘇慧貞) mentioned that the school was one of the first universities in the country to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Su linked the extraordinary achievement to the school's wide range of applications, from internal affairs in campus, to participating in international medical and humanity rescue services.
The Impact Rankings were evaluated based on each university’s ability to support and deliver on the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals. NCKU stood out in the categories of SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG9 (Industry Innovations and Infrastructure), and SDG14 (Life Below Water) across the higher education sector — of which it ranked among the top 20 in the world.

4,quality-education,NCKU’s LDT School Project Interacts with the Public off Campus With Achievements,"After three years and a half, NCKU’s LDT School (Liberal Arts/Design/Technology) project has come to an end. To display the achievements and joy of the 51 courses offered during the project’s 1279 days, an exhibition was held at an off-campus venue, the Asir Art Museum. Unlike most exhibitions, the teachers and students behind the exhibition presented city memories and information to visitors via fun interactions with them so that they would build more ties with the city.
The achievements of the project can be divided into three major categories: university, city, and industry. One wall displayed the words “What makes a city?” and invited visitors to choose what they thought to be key terms using yarn, such as “everlasting”, “convenient life”, and “diverse culture”. This also revealed what citizens cared most about. The teachers and students also designed questions for visitors to answer by signs that could be flipped, and in some cases, they provided darts that visitors could use to choose and answer questions with. Successful challengers could win tote bags, specially-made drinks, or products made personally by the students by hand. It made for a lot of fun at the exhibition.
One special exhibit contained the achievements of the Archaeology and Design course, where students contemplated the meaning of cultural heritage from the perspective of archaeology. With Tainan City as the venue of field study, they observed the cultural morphology of the city as it formed. Some students used the colors of beef soups from different eateries to design the packaging of black tea bags and included introductions to each unique soup base, which showed much ingenuity. Taking inspiration from the traditional Taoist custom of drinking charm ash water, other students made ""blessed candy” to preserve the imagery of burning charms and enable believers to be similarly blessed and protected. Still other students designed tea sets based on the four most important stages of life in traditions: birth, coming of age, marriage, and old age.
Project director and NCKU president Jenny Huey-Jen Su visited the exhibition with excitement and gratitude. She stated that these achievements served as crucial steps in humanities education for NCKU and its College of Liberal Arts and even for Tainan and Taiwan. Seeing so many students gain a better capacity to imagine and narrate, she believes that there are higher, further, and more different starting points out there. “The LDT School is not the end but the start of a new challenge and new future brands.”
Professor Yuhneu Chen, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and one of the co-directors of the project, indicated that these 51 courses made a breakthrough in intercollegiate relations. A total of 62 teachers took part in the project. “Co-creating with teachers and students in other fields, inviting citizens to participate in our activities, and sharing our resources are extremely important things.” She is pleased to see that the works of their students can connect to other venues off campus, enabling the classroom to really extend to Tainan. Every little feedback from the city has become infinite teaching materials.
Dean Tay-Sheng Jeng of the College of Planning and Design, the other co-director of the project, pointed out many good experiences in the past three years. When the College of Liberal Arts made the step to collaborate with other colleges, the new value that they created together was something that could not be seen anywhere else. “It was very impressive in thickness, depth, and breadth.”
Yu-Ting Weng, a sophomore majoring in Taiwanese literature, took the elective course Sweet Tainan: The Memories and Representations of Sugar Industry in Tainan. She elatedly shared her experiences of brainstorming with students in different fields and being creative with product designs. “You could even really work with businesses and create value. It was so fun!” They designed new eye-catching labels for a clam essence product and used word play to create interesting slogans.
NCKU’s LDT School project was funded by the Ministry of Education’s 2015 Project of Cultivation of Humanities and Social Sciences Competence in Interdisciplinary Field Application, which ran from August of 2015 to January of 2019. During this project, an experiment on humanities and innovation was jointly carried out by the various colleges of NCKU. The 51 courses covered a variety of content, including composing and performing traditional Chinese opera, hand-making original books with illustrations, Matsu work camps, documentary work camps, and cultural design apps.
Aside from the courses, they also renovated the NCKU Museum of History, creating a venue that can be fully used by students and teachers and fit better in campus life. Their hope is to build connections between Tainan and the international community, examine how the humanities in Tainan developed from the perspectives of culture, geography, history, cities, architecture, and historical sites, and promote world heritage concepts and education.
成功大學「創意三角洲：建構大學、城市、產業的鏈結」計畫執行3年半進入尾聲，特別規劃在校外場地甘樂阿舍美術館，展示1279個日子以來51門課程的輝煌與歡樂。有別於一般展覽，師生共創透過有趣的方式和民眾互動，讓民眾帶走城市的記憶與資訊，和城市產生更多鏈結，成果展至1月8日為止。
創意三角洲計畫成果展包括大學、城市、產業三大主軸，在牆面上設計「What makes a city？」版面，讓民眾用毛線挑選出自己認為重要的關鍵字，諸如「川流不息」、「生活便捷」、「多元文化」等等，藉此也能看出市民最在意的重點。師生還設計問題讓民眾透過翻牌答題，或射飛鏢選題答題，通關成功者可獲得手提袋、特調飲料或學生親手製作的產業成品，現場歡樂不斷。
此外，特別展出「考古與設計」課程成果，學生從考古學的角度思考文化資產的意義，以台南府城作為田野實習場域，體驗府城形成過程的文化風貌。有學生以各家牛肉湯顏色變化設計紅茶茶包包裝，並附上各具特色的湯底介紹，別具巧思；還有學生以傳統習俗「喝符水」出發，改藉由糖當作轉化做出「福糖」，保留燒符意象，一樣能獲得祝福與保佑；也有學生以傳統禮俗中4個重要的生命階段－出生、成年、結婚、老年，設計出茶具組。
計畫主持人成大校長蘇慧貞參觀成果展既興奮又感謝，認為無論對於成大或文學院，甚至是對台南、台灣，都是人文教育上很重要的軌跡。看到很多學生都能夠有更多想像力、敘事力，也相信還能有更高、更遠、更不一樣的出發。「創意三角洲不是一個結束，而是開創了一個挑戰，也會成為以後新的品牌的開始。」
計劃共同主持人之一成大文學院院長陳玉女認為，51門課程突破了各個學院的合作關係，總共有62位老師共同參與，「跟其他領域的師生共創，迎接市民參與我們的活動，分享我們的資源，是非常重要的事情。」她欣喜看到學生的作品可以鏈結到校外許多場域，讓教室可以真的延伸到大台南，從這個城市所有點滴回饋，也變成無窮無盡的教材。
計劃共同主持人成大規劃與設計學院院長鄭泰昇也指出，過去3年多來有許多非常好的經驗，當文學院跨出領域和其他學院合作，一起創造出來的新的價值是其他地方看不見的，「無論厚度、深度、廣度都讓人刮目相看。」
台文系二年級同學翁瑜廷，選修計畫中的「甘蜜臺南－府城與糖業記憶再現」工作坊，她雀躍分享和不同領域的同學一起腦力激盪，在產品設計上大玩創意，「還能實際跟產業合作產生新的價值，非常好玩！」他們設計蠔蜆精命名為「蠔蜆有你」，包裝外還加上「只有更蠔、超越級蜆」、「蜆在蠔想你」等字樣，特別吸睛。
成大創意三角洲計畫為教育部「104年度人文及社會科學知識跨界應用能力培育計畫」補助，自2015年8月啟動至2019年1月落幕，期間結合校內各學院進行一場人文創新的實驗。51門課程多元豐富，有古典戲曲製演、原創手工圖文書製作、馬祖工作營、紀錄片工作營、文化設計APP等等。
課程之外，也重啟歷史文物館新貌，打造成可供師生有效利用的場域，也更融入校園生活，希望帶動城市、國際的鏈結，思考台南文化地理、歷史、都市、建築、古蹟等人文空間形成的過程，推動跨國際性世界文化遺產的認知教育。（撰文、攝影／朱怡婷）

4,quality-education,NCKU’s Cross-disciplinary X-Village Course Breaks Conventions and Rebuilds Teaching from the Ground Up,"This summer, NCKU offered an experimental high-intensity progressive IT course called X-Village for college students majoring in fields other than information technology in Taiwan. With six hours of class a day, five days a week, and homework for the students to complete every day, the teachers and teaching assistants were running at full steam. While not all students could complete the course, the majority found the challenge a welcome opportunity to grow and develop. Upon completion of the first phase of the course, the students gained basic IT skills and built bonds of trust with one another, which opens up a range of possibilities for their careers. What surprised the teachers was how proactive the students were in learning.
X-Village is an experimental education project supported by the Ministry of Education. The course comprises two phases: one that ended in September and another which will go on to April . The goal of the project is to cultivate cross-disciplinary talent and provide a platform for cross-disciplinary exchange. Through suitable teaching materials and guidance, they hope to open the gates of computer science to students in different colleges, enable them to understand programming language and write programs, and even create a bridge for collaboration between information engineering and different academic fields. Professor Alvin Wen. Yu. Su and Associate Professor Kun-Ta Chuang of the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at NCKU serve as the conveners of the project. The curriculum was designed by a supervisor with more than 20 years of experience in the industry. This curriculum includes basic Python programming, the fundamentals of computer science, collaborative learning on computer science, and interdisciplinary project development.
When the X-Village project was announced, over 160 applications were received from universities throughout Taiwan. The applicants included all sorts of majors in literature, management, medicine, architecture, engineering, and design. In the end, 45 students and 45 auditors were admitted. To enable these students with non-IT backgrounds to grasp the thinking and language of computer science in the shortest time possible, 20 students in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at NCKU were selected and trained to serve as teaching assistants during the course. Furthermore, a five-week weekend introductory course to programming was made available to 45 students from senior high school and vocational high schools, with priority given to disadvantaged students from rural areas. The 45 university students taking the X-Village course were required to serve as the teaching assistants to the 45 high school students and help them learn one-on-one. The final grade of the high school students served as the grade of their teaching assistant.
The X-Village students received intensive instruction for a full two months. Associate Professor Kun-Ta Chuang said that not all of the students could keep up with the pressure. Among the students involved, 5 students, 22 auditors, and 5 high school students dropped out. The students spent more than 10 hours every day learning about computer science, a domain unfamiliar to them, and on top of that, they had to teach high school students on the weekends. The pressure was high. The concept of using the grades of the high school students to stand as the grades of the university students is an innovative approach that took some adjustment from the students, but by the end of the course, many students commented on the immense value and meaning in the feedback they received from the high school students.
Professor Alvin Su explained that to complete the course, the high school students gave oral presentations. Some of them were so nervous, it was most likely their first time speaking in front of an audience. The care and effort they extended into their speeches were touching for everyone who participated. Afterwards, one high school student revealed that he studied as hard as he could after every class at NCKU because he was afraid that any poor performance on his part would affect the university student who taught him. Professor Alvin Su pointed out that upon observation, he found that the university students also examined their own understanding as they taught the high school students. This achieved the goal of teaching benefiting the teachers and showed them that knowledge can be used to help people.
Shao-Wei Chuang, one of the students and a business management major, said that he had applied for the X-Village course because he wanted to create more opportunities for himself. He said that he learned a lot and built his skillset during the two months, but more importantly, his whole mindset shifted, he found partners in various fields, and he gained both creative thinking skills and a wider perspective. He confessed that the first two weeks were the hardest. His days consisted only of eating, sleeping, and programming. He spent a lot of time trying to understand the problems and structures and figuring out ways to write the program he wanted. Sometimes he worked all night with no success. He described it as walking in a long dark tunnel with no end in sight, and he thought of quitting many times. Fortunately, the teaching assistants were very patient with him, helping him with programming, and listening to his complaints. It gave him the will to stick it out, and he slowly began to improve.
Aside from programming tasks, the students taking the course also had to propose projects and complete them in groups. They had to persuade other students to join their projects or be persuaded to join someone else’s project. In the beginning, there were 12 groups. After further screening and showdowns, some students were eliminated. In the end, only four groups containing about a dozen people went on to the second phase. The remaining students faced even greater pressure, but they were determined to succeed. Professor Alvin Su said that it was not easy for the students to work through such a strenuous course, but what they gained in the end was worth all their time and effort.
成大今年暑假針對全國非資訊工程系的學生，進行一場高強度，由淺入深的資訊科技教育實驗課程 X-Village。每週學習 ５ 天，每天上課 6 小時，課後還有當天要完成的作業，師生、助教都被操到累翻，有的學生壓力大退出，但更多人選擇留下來。第一階段課程告一段落，被「苦毒」的學生們，均練出了跨入資訊領域的基本功，也建立起信任及革命情感，為彼此的未來帶來更多可能。最讓老師驚喜的是，學生主動學習的態度遠超乎預期，有些未能進入第二階段的學生，竟然不斷想方設法爭取留下接受挑戰，就盼能夠學到更多。
X-Village 是成大在教育部支持下進行的實驗教育計畫，課程分兩階段，第一階段在9月告一段落，第二階段至 108 年 4 月。計畫目的在培育跨領域能力人才及提供跨域交流平台，以期透過適當的教材與引導，讓不同學院的學生，也能跨入電腦科學的大門（懂程式語言、會寫程式），甚至成為不同學術領域與資工合作的橋樑。課程由成大資訊工程系蘇文鈺教授、莊坤達副教授擔任計畫召集人，委請業界 2 0年經驗以上的主管負責課程設計，內容涵蓋 Python 基礎程式設計、電腦科學基礎、資訊科技教學協同學習以及跨領域專案實作。
X-Village計畫公布後，來自北、中、南、東等大學報名人數超過 160 人，背景從文學、管理、醫學、建築、工程、設計等都有，最後錄取45名學員，45 名旁聽生，為了讓非資訊工程背景的學生能在最短時間掌握電腦科學的思維與語言，又精選並訓練 20 名成大資工系學生，課程期間全程在旁擔任助教。更特別的是，還以偏鄉弱勢優先，招收45名高中職學子參加為期 5 週，每週六、日來上程式設計入門課， 45 名X-Village大學生學員還必須擔任45名高中職生的教學助教，進行1對1教學協同學習，高中生學習到最後的成績，就是指導他的大學生的成績。
暑假不能出門玩樂，不能去實習也不能去打工，得結結實實被操兩個月。莊坤達不否認，確實有人因壓力太大或跟不上進度而「落跑」，45 名學員跑了５人，45 名旁聽生剩 23 人，高中生也有 5 人選擇退出。莊坤達回想起來有些不忍心的說，參加的學生每天幾乎被操10 多個小時，去探索不熟悉的電腦科學，還要負責教會高中生，那種壓力真的很大。有的學員因神經過於緊繃，而忍不住向老師、助教抱怨「為什麼別人學不會，竟成了教的人的責任，太不公平了。」不過，在宣洩情緒之後，仍然重新投入，而且他們也慢慢地從高中生的學習回饋中，感受到付出的意義與價值。
蘇文鈺說，高中生結業時需上台做報告，他們有些人的表現看來很生澀，應該是生平第一次上台，好緊張的樣子，台下人也忍不住跟著著急，但孩子那種用心程度，讓人非常感動。有一名高中生事後透露，每次到成大上完課，回家都會很努力複習，就怕沒學懂，表現不理想，拖累了教導他的大學生。蘇文鈺指出，從旁觀察發現，大學生學員在教高中生的過程中也檢視了本身所學以及理解的程度，達到教學相長的目，也了解到「知識是可以用來幫助人的」。
企管系學員莊少維說，報名參加X-Village是希望為未來創造更多發展的空間，兩個月下來收穫滿滿，不僅工具技能提升，更多的是思維轉變，還有不同領域夥伴合作，帶來思考刺激以及視野的提升。只是前兩星期好痛苦，每天睡覺吃飯外都在寫程式，花很多時間了解題目以及結構，去思考如何寫出想要的程式，經常想了一整晚仍沒收穫，猶如走在漫長暗黑隧道裡，看不見盡頭，常興起放棄念頭，幸好助教們耐心十足地陪寫程式、聽抱怨，自己撐了下去也逐漸進入狀況。
教高中生也是很特別的經驗，為了教人，必須不斷反思與咀嚼學到電腦科學知識，就怕被高中生問倒會很難堪，看到所教的高中生確實理解，而且提出作品，那種欣慰與成就感，至今難忘。莊少維也透露另一個「成果」，兩個月來日夜忙程式以及準備最後的實作專題，每天三餐加宵夜，大家平均胖了 4 公斤。
參加課程的學員除了學寫程式外，也要提出想做的專案之後再分組實作，而且學生必須去說服別人加入自己的專案，不然就是被說服加入其他人的專案，一開始組成 12 隊，經過一再篩選與對決，有些人因淘汰離開，最後只剩 4 隊 10 多人進入第二階段。留下來的學生，壓力有增無減，但都咬牙不放棄，強烈的學習動機，莊坤達、蘇文鈺都說，這麼累、如此苦毒學生的課程，還願意待著，真不容易，不枉費花那麼多的心力來做 X-Village。
莊坤達說，其實，第一階段課程才做一個月，當老師的已經驚喜地感受到學生積極主動的學習態度，暑假結束時，學生被淘汰得只剩下4隊專案，料想不到的是，竟有學生不甘心被迫離開，有的爭取加入最後的 4 隊，有的繼續提案想說服業師讓他們留下，或是接受業師提的專案以便能留下來，學生玩真的，當老師的最大的回饋莫過於此，真是令人欣慰。
莊坤達表示，X-Village 打破了許多傳統課程框架，建立了一些機制，也有美好的必穫，希望就算計畫結束，也能在成大校園內延續，讓不同學院的學生都可以真正跨入電腦科學大門，整合跨域知識、創新，發揮電腦科學的價值。

To establish a campus environment that promotes gender diversity and rights, the seminar included keynote speeches and discussed case studies. The goal is to promote awareness of gender equality and to devise an adequate foundation for gender equality education.
In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Based on the perspectives of humanity, the Earth, prosperity, peace, and partnership, the 17 SDGs serve as shared guidelines for countries to complete sustainable development tasks before 2030. NCKU President Dr. Huey-Jen Jenny Su recognized the SDGs as institutional development goals and adopted sustainable development concepts as an integral component of these goals, integrating the SDGs into the education and research goals of the university. Doing so, NCKU deepens faculty and student recognition of social responsibilities and values, demonstrates its social influence, and contributes to the global effort to achieve the SDGs.
The seminar invited domestic experts and scholars in gender studies and experts with experience in gender equality issues to share their personal experience and research. Additionally, five sessions on strategies and goals for the promotion of gender equality goals were held for participants to exchange gender equality promotion experiences and to reflect on current gender equality education policies in Taiwan. Additionally, the book Woman Images of NCKU was launched, voicing and celebrating the achievements of NCKU’s female instructors for higher education of Taiwan.
President Su stated that SDG 5 to achieve gender equality and empower all women not only emphasizes gender equality as a basic human right; it is a core objective for achieving all UN SDGs. The achievement of every SDG involves gender equality. Only by ensuring that each SDG protects women’s rights can we achieve a sustainable development future that benefits all.
Finally, Hsing-Chuan Tsai, Director of the Center for Gender and Women’s Studies, and Professor Su-lin Yu, the seminar convenor, expressed their gratitude to each expert promoting gender equality education for their attendance. By encouraging a consensus through dialogues between multiple parties, the seminar consolidated efforts to promote the SDGs and realize the vision of gender equality.

5,gender-equality,Personality Traits and Individual Attitudes toward Same-Sex Marriage in Taiwan,"Assistant Professor　 Wang, Ching-Hsing       Department of Political Science, NCKU
*This article is mainly based on our paper entitled “Personality Traits and Individual Attitudes toward Same-Sex Marriage: Evidence from Taiwan” that is accepted for publication inSexuality Research and Social Policy.
On May 17, 2019, Taiwan’s legislature passed a same-sex marriage bill to make Taiwan the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. The legalization of same-sex marriage in Taiwan is mainly attributed to the ruling of Constitutional Court on May 24, 2017 that the statutory ban on same-sex marriage in Taiwan’s Civil Code violated both the people’s freedom of marriage as protected by Article 22 and the people’s right to equality as guaranteed by Article 7 of the Constitution. The anti-marriage equality group had attempted to resort to referendums to repeal the Constitutional Court’s ruling and the results of referendums on November 24, 2018 showed that same-sex marriage rights and LGBT-inclusive education in schools were rejected by Taiwanese voters. Nevertheless, the results of referendums failed to overturn legislation of same-sex marriage in Taiwan. While some Taiwanese people are very glad to see that same-sex marriage is finally legalized, it seems that the majority of Taiwanese people are not ready to accept legislation of same-sex marriage given the results of referendums. Furthermore, a survey we conducted immediately after the 2018 local elections also demonstrated that more than half (52.9%) of Taiwanese people do not support legislation of same-sex marriage.
Why do the majority of Taiwanese people hold negative attitudes toward same-sex marriage? Although same-sex marriage has been a particularly salient social issue in recent years in Taiwan, little scholarly attention has been paid to the determinants of individual attitudes toward same-sex marriage. Past studies in the United States and European countries have indicated that the level of personal contact with homosexual people, attitude toward traditional morality, religion, and demographic factors such as education, gender and age have significant influences on public opinion about homosexuality. Different from previous research, we attempted to understand individual attitudes toward same-sex marriage in Taiwan from the perspective of personality. Since personality can shape individuals’ thinking and behavioral patterns and play an important role in individuals’ interactions with other people and reactions to external stimuli, numerous studies have employed personality to examine individual political attitudes and behavior. Besides, it is documented that genetics plays a major role in personality formation and personality is generally stable over the life span. Therefore, scholars have assumed that personality is causally prior to any specific attitudes or behaviors. While there are many different dimensions of personality, psychologists have agreed that individuals’ personalities can be described by five basic dimensions named as the Big Five personality traits which can be summarized as follows: (1) extraversion is the tendency to be energetic and outgoing and seek stimulation and the company of others; (2) agreeableness is the tendency to be compassionate, cooperative, considerate and sympathetic; (3) conscientiousness is the tendency to show self-discipline, act dutifully, and aim for achievement; (4) emotional stability is the tendency to be calm, even-tempered, and less likely to feel tense or rattled; and (5) openness to experience is the tendency to be creative, imaginative, curious and open to new ideas.
To examine the relationships between the Big Five personality traits and individual attitudes toward same-sex marriage in Taiwan, we fielded a telephone survey in 2017 after the ruling of Constitutional Court. We found that the trait of agreeableness has a negative effect on support for same-sex marriage. That is, people with higher levels of agreeableness are more likely to oppose same-sex marriage. Besides, conscientiousness and openness to experience have heterogeneous effects on individual attitudes toward same-sex marriage for people of different ages. That is, a higher level of conscientiousness is positively associated with support for same-sex marriage among younger people, but is negatively correlated with support for same-sex marriage among older people. Similarly, a higher level of openness to experience would lead to increased support for same-sex marriage for younger people, but would result in decreased support for same-sex marriage for older people. Overall, we provided empirical evidence that personality as an endogenous factor (i.e., individual psychological factor) could provide some explanatory power for individual attitudes toward homosexual rights.
Some might worry about the above results because personality traits are mainly due to genetic influences and relatively stable over time. That is, once people are high on some personality traits that are linked to negative attitudes toward homosexuals, they might not change their attitudes toward homosexual rights. However, we should not be so pessimistic because people with different personality traits might interact with external environment to change their attitudes toward homosexual rights. Therefore, as social atmosphere changes, people with different personality traits might adjust their attitudes toward homosexuals.

＊此文內容主要來自於我們發表在Sexuality Research and Social Policy 期刊的論文「Personality Traits and Individual Attitudes toward Same-Sex Marriage: Evidence from Taiwan」。
2019年5月17日臺灣的立法院通過同性婚姻法案，使得臺灣成為第一個同性婚姻合法化的亞洲國家。臺灣同性婚姻合法化主要歸功於大法官會議2017年5月24日的釋憲判決，其認為臺灣民法中對於同性婚姻的法律禁止違反憲法第22條所保障的婚姻自由以及第7條所保障的平等權。反對婚姻平權團體嘗試透過公民投票來廢止大法官會議的判決，而2018年11月24日的公民投票結果顯示，臺灣選民反對同性婚姻權利以及在學校實施性別平權教育。儘管如此，公民投票的結果並無法推翻臺灣的同性婚姻合法化。雖然一些臺灣民眾樂於見到同性婚姻最終被合法化，鑒於公民投票的結果，似乎大多數的臺灣民眾尚未準備好接受同性婚姻合法化。此外，我們在2018年地方選舉後立即執行的一項調查中也顯示，超過半數（52.9%）的臺灣民眾並不支持同性婚姻合法化。
為何多數的臺灣民眾對於同性婚姻抱持負面的態度呢？雖然同性婚姻近幾年在臺灣成為一個重要的社會議題，但是卻很少有學者關注影響個人對於同性婚姻態度的因素。過去歐美的研究已經指出，個人與同性戀者的接觸程度、對於傳統道德的態度、宗教，以及人口特徵，如教育程度、性別和年齡，會對個人對於同性戀者的態度產生顯著的影響。不同於過去的研究，我們嘗試透過人格的觀點來瞭解個人對於同性婚姻的態度。由於人格可以形塑個人的思考和行為模式，並且在個人與其他人的互動以及回應外在的刺激上扮演著重要的角色，許多研究已經利用人格來檢視個人的政治態度和行為。另外，亦記載基因在人格形成上扮演著主要的角色，以及人格在人生過程中往往是穩定的。因此，學者認為人格在因果關係上早於任何特定的態度和行為。雖然人格可以包含許多不同的面向，但是心理學者同意個人的人格可以被五個基本面向所描述，稱為「人格五大特質」，摘要如下：（一）外向性：有活力的、外向的，以及尋求他人的鼓舞和陪伴；（二）親和性：有同情心、合作的、體貼的，以及憐憫的；（三）嚴謹性：自律的、有責任感的，以及具有目標性；（四）情緒穩定性：平靜的、性情穩定，以及較不容易感到緊張或擔憂；（五）開放性：有創意的、有想像力的、好奇的，以及接受新的想法。
為了檢視在臺灣人格五大特質和個人對於同性婚姻態度之間的關係，我們在2017年的大法官釋憲判決之後進行了一項電話調查。我們發現親和性對於同性婚姻的支持具有負面的影響，亦即親和性愈高的民眾愈可能反對同性婚姻。此外，嚴謹性和開放性對於不同年齡的民眾的同性婚姻態度具有異質性的影響，亦即對於較年輕的民眾，高嚴謹性和支持同性婚姻具有正向的關係，但是對於較年長的民眾，高嚴謹性和支持同性婚姻則是具有負向的關係。同樣地，對於較年輕的民眾，高開放性可以增加對於同性婚姻的支持，但是對於較年長的民眾，則是降低對於同性婚姻的支持。整體而言，我們提供了經驗證據顯示，人格作為一項內生性因素（即個人心理因素）可以對個人對於同性權益的態度提供一些解釋力。
有些人或許會擔心上述的結果，因為人格特質主要受到基因的影響以及隨著時間的推移具有相對穩定的特性。換言之，一旦人們在某些與對同性戀者持負面態度的人格特質上有較高的傾向時，他們可能不會改變其對於同性權益的態度。然而，我們不應該如此悲觀，因為具有不同人格特質的民眾可能經由與外在環境的互動，進而改變其對於同性權益的態度。因此，隨著社會氛圍的改變，具有不同人格特質的民眾可能會調整其對同性戀者的態度。

5,gender-equality,Raise the Torch for a sustainable future – Dr. Brundtland received an honorary doctorate from NCKU President Dr. Su,"Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland received an honorary doctorate degree of Medicine of from the National Cheng Kung University President Dr. Huey-Jen Jenny Su (蘇慧貞) at the closing ceremony of the third Gro Brundtland Week of Women in Sustainable Development on April 3rd. The lecture was attended with NCKU faculty and students from Tainan First Senior High School and Tainan Sheng Kung High schools. On the same day, Dr. Brundtland presented a plenary lecture on “Sustainable Development Goals, a Thirty Year Story of International Collaboration” and attended the 2018 Brundtland Week closing ceremony.
“We are privileged to present the honorary doctorate of Medicine to Dr. Brundtland,” said Dr. Su. “Dr. Brundtland’s path-taking endeavors have profoundly inspired hundreds and thousands of public health practitioners, environmental scientists, and to some extent the politicians around the world to believe that there can always be a great calling and higher aim regardless of the disciplines if we bring passion and vision into each and every one of our profession.”
At the commencement of the lecture, Dr. Brundtland gave her word of appreciation to Tang Prize Foundation for the grant, with which NCKU has successfully assembled the Brundtland Week of Women in sustainable development for three years. Dr. Brundtland started to share her thirty year journey in sustainable development with a phenomenal global event back in 2015, when The United Nations approves the Sustainable Development Goals. “It brings the global countries and leaders together for a common future. This is my life story of 30 years, to engage for sustainable development and our common future.”
“When there is a hope, push for a change.”
“I want to change the society and the attitude,” said Dr. Brundtland. “A doctor is who wanted to heal and who wanted to change. Not least to change the causes of suffering and injustice. There is a very close connection between being a doctor and a politician. The doctor tries to prevent illness, the tries to treat it if it comes. That’s exactly the same as what you try to do as a politician, but regard to society.”
Gro Harlem Brundtland, A medical doctor and Master of Public Health (MPH), spent 10 years as a physician and scientist in the Norwegian public health system, before she was nominated as Norwegian Environmental Minister in 1974, and the first female Prime Minister of Norway in 1981. With her domestic political career, Dr Brundtland has developed a growing concern for issues of global significance. In 1983, she chaired the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development, and published the 1987 Brundtland Report, “Our Common Future”, which introduced sustainable development into global agenda at the Earth Summit in 1992 and Kyoto Protocol in 1997.
Dr. Brundtland continues to tackle on the global challenges of public health and climate change. Elected as the Director-General of the World Health Organization in 1998, she set the tone to “be combating disease and ill-health - promoting sustainable and equitable health systems in all countries” in her acceptance speech for the World Health Assembly. Among her accomplishments were negotiating a major multilateral treaty on tobacco, as well as the rapid response to the SARS epidemic, for which she was named Policy Leader of the Year by Scientific American Magazine.
Dr. Brundtland was appointed as the UN Special Envoys for Climate Change in 2007 and a member of UN Secretary Generals’ “High Level Global Sustainability Panel” in 2010. With her effort, the approval of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 and the Paris Agreement show that there is a global commitment now to acknowledging the problem and working together to solve it.
Recognized as “the mother of sustainable development, Dr. Brundtland travels and lectures extensively as a leading voice on climate change, an advocate for a healthier and better educated world, and a champion of sustainable development.
“Sustainable Development is s development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” – Our Common Future, 1987 the Brundtland Report
“Everything is linked to everything else. Environment and development are to be integrated,” said Dr. Brundtland on April 3rd. “We care for the quality of growth. We need to make the consequences transparent, to education the generations, to engage the private sectors, to take on global responsibility, to introduce innovation and change policies. We need to reduce the impact of global warming and climate change, for our common future.”
Brundtland Week of Women in Sustainable Development (2016-2018)
“The Brundtland Week of Women in Sustainable Development is a generous and visionary initiative from Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland,” said Dr. Su. “The Gro Brundtland Week of Women in Sustainable Development was made possible by her generosity aimed to enhance the involvement of younger women researchers from developing countries in the issues of sustainable development and public health, and to build a network and support system among female scientists from different countries.”
The Brundtland Week is a three-year project, from 2016 to 2018, granted with Dr. Brundtland’s Tang Prize in 2014. With Dr. Brundtland’s grant her 2014 Tang Prize award, the Brundtland Week awards fifteen outstanding female scientists to visit Taiwan. Tang Prize Foundation CEO Chern Jenn-Chuan (陳振川) said, “Tang Prize grant is used for a good cause. It is the partnership that matters.” With her 2014 Tang Prize money, Dr. Brundtland also grants the community hygiene programs in Tanzania.
The 2018 Brundtland Week award was given to Dr. Natisha Dukhi (South Africa), Dr. Barbara Burmen (Kenya), Dr. Neha Dahiya (India), Dr. Weena Gera (Philippines) and Dr. Sarva Mangala Praveena (Malaysia). They co-presented on “Healthy Cities in Asia and Africa: Exploring Community Initiatives to Address Air Pollution in Complex urban system” to NCKU President Dr. Su and Dr. Brundtland, after the award ceremony.
Raise our torch for a sustainable future
At the closing of 2018 Brundtland Week, Dr. Su said, “I am also hopeful and motivated when we officially close to the weeklong activities as what you have presented which are comprised of diverse disciplines and carrying the ultimate spirit of sustainability…the network and capacity to facilitate sustainability development is seeded in another corner of the globe. Taiwan, as a country, and I myself as the professor, are proud to showcase you the next batch of capable cadets as we raise our torch for a sustainable future!”
成功大學3日頒發名譽博士學位予挪威前總理格羅．哈萊姆．布倫特蘭女士（Gro Harlem Brundtland），她被譽為「永續發展教母」，是首屆唐獎永續發展獎得主。成大校長蘇慧貞推崇Dr. Gro Brundtland身為全球卓越領袖，歷任挪威總理、聯合國環境與發展委員會主席及世界衛生組織總幹事等職位，推動環境永續發展，並激勵許多女性科學家進行重要工作改善人類生活品質，「成大以莫大的榮譽歡迎挪威國母接受名譽博士，繼續推動未來世代在兼顧環境永續與經濟發展的平衡目標。」
蘇慧貞校長指出，Dr. Gro Brundtland是醫生也是政治人物，醫生的工作主要在預防及治療疾病，政治則是在預防社會問題創造解決方案並擴及全球影響力。永續發展的主要目標就是在經濟發展的同時兼顧環境永續，Dr. Gro Brundtland不但捐出獎金中的500萬元支持「女性永續發展科學週」活動，提供了女性科學家交流與合作的平台，也有機會看到台灣不同區域面臨的挑戰。
蘇慧貞校長也推崇，Dr. Gro Brundtland捐出另一部份獎金在坦尚尼亞支援262個單位改善當地環境衛生，讓230萬人受益，同時更激勵無數女性科學家從事更重要工作，改善了人類生活品質與永續發展。Dr. Gro Brundtland的先生Arne Olav Brundtland此次特別陪同來到成大，校長蘇慧貞致詞時透露，Arne Olav Brundtland是國際關係專家，但身處保守黨，與Dr. Gro Brundtland隸屬的工黨是不同黨派，每天吃早餐都像開國際研討會。引起現場一片笑聲。
授予典禮上午在成大格致堂舉行，校長蘇慧貞親自為Dr. Gro Brundtland撥穗、授證，副教務長王育民宣讀推薦書，2018女性永續發展科學週5位Gro Brundtland Award得獎者、成大黃正弘副校長等主管以及Dr. Gro Brundtland的先生Arne Olav Brundtland皆出席觀禮。Dr. Gro Brundtland隨後以「Sustainable Development Goals, a Thirty Year Story of International Collaboration（聯合國永續發展目標：回溯30年國際合作概況）」為題發表演說。
Dr. Gro Brundtland在演說中表示，她35年來致力於推動國際合作，促進全球永續發展，1983年擔任聯合國環境與發展委員會主席，1987年發布《我們共同的未來》（Our Common Future）的報告，又稱為《布倫特蘭報告》，並成為1992年在巴西里約熱內盧召開的第一屆聯合國環境與發展大會（UNCED），亦稱「地球高峰會」（Earth Summit）的主要議程。同年也推動了「21世紀議程」（Agenda 21），視之為人類邁向永續發展的藍圖。
1998年她擔任世界衛生組織總幹事，積極推動全球性傳染病的防治，包括愛滋病、瘧疾、SARS等，並推動菸害防治，減少菸業廣告。在「地球高峰會」上，聯合國也首次討論了全球氣候變遷的相關問題，訂定了重要的國際協議如「聯合國氣候變遷框架公約」（UNFCCC）及「京都協議」（Kyoto Protocol）等，藉以致力於延緩或降低人類所受氣候變遷的衝擊。
Dr. Gro Brundtland指出，地球氣候變遷及人口成長造成水資源缺乏及食物供應壓力，此外全球國家貧富不均使得貧窮國家受到上述問題更大影響，當時在《布倫特蘭報告》中即已提出。她曾一再強調，「永續發展是符合當代發展需求又不能犧牲下一代福祉。」代表必須正視經濟成長的品質，不傷害環境，減少全球暖化、氣候變遷的影響，政策的改變勢在必行，某些國家的能源政策將會造成貧窮國家的衝擊，例如在非洲、中國等地區創造經濟成長的模式造成全球社會不穩定，而這都是為了「我們共同的未來」必須努力的方向。
演講後特別開放在場學子提問，聖功女中同學提問，在推動女性平權數十年歷程中曾遭遇何種挑戰？Dr. Gro Brundtland回答指出，她最近曾看到1則新聞影片剪輯，回顧1961年針對挪威民眾意見調查，受訪的50多歲男性民眾直言應該要由男性擔任總理，但受訪的年輕女性卻說：也該是改變的時候了。但是改變並非一蹴可及，1981年她當上第一任女性總理，民眾的態度在她總理任期中才慢慢改變，2013年挪威選出第二位女性總理，大眾理所當然的接受，再沒有性別上的質疑。
Dr. Gro Brundtland說，母親曾質疑她為何要從政，而她回答，「因為想改變社會、改變民眾的態度，等到下一任女性總理上任時就會有所不同。我證明了我是對的！這也激勵大家，只要認為有希望就要去努力推動讓改變發生，現在是女人說話的時代，男人應該要更加傾聴。」
法學院學生詢問如何平衡職涯與家庭，Dr. Gro Brundtland說，自己曾任挪威環境部長、總理也曾任政黨黨魁，任期中她不斷推動兩性平權，為提高女性權利，從法規制度面改變家庭傳統觀念，例如她曾積極推動產假，在她那一代產假12週，她女兒是18週，而到她孫女則可有1年產假，同時男性也有育嬰假14至52週。
【小檔案】Gro Harlem Brundtland於1963年畢業於奧斯陸大學醫學系、1965年獲美國哈佛大學公共衛生碩士學位、1974年出任工黨政府環境保護大臣、1975年當選工黨副主席、1981年出任挪威首相，成為挪威歷史上第一位女首相、1984年被聯合國秘書長任命為聯合國環境與發展委員會主席、1998年擔任世界衛生組織總幹事、2014年獲首屆唐獎永續發展獎。

5,gender-equality,Woman Power Takes off at NCKU with Cross-national WUN Project: “Marriage Migrants in Asia”,"Professor Su-Lin Yu and supporting professors from the National Cheng Kung University’s Center for Gender & Women’s Studies are collaborating with 11 female scholars from Hong Kong, Macau and Japan to launch the “Marriage Migrants in Asia” project, which has been recognized by the Worldwide Universities Network (WUN) as one of the 14 most influential projects of 2018.
Through the conscientious efforts of these knowledgeable women, this unprecedented cross-national collaborative project aims to collect and analyze data acquired from field interviews and historical records. Social-statistics methods will be used to draw comparisons and initiate discussions regarding the findings from the project. The end goal is a holistic understanding of marriage migrants in Asia. The project will provide useful reference material for policymakers around the world.
Founded in 2000, the WUN is the world’s most robust alliance of research-intensive universities. As a leading global higher education network, the WUN focuses on solving global issues. Su-Lin Yu is a professor at National Cheng Kung University. Unable to ignore the plight of marriage migrants, Yu gathered professors from the NCKU Center for Gender & Women’s Studies, including Kai-ling Liu, Mei-tzu Tsai, Tiffany Hsu, Wei-ming Luh, and Le-kun Tan. She also reached out to professors from abroad, including Hsun-hui Tseng from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Susan Broomhall, Samina Yasmeen, and Loretta Baldassar from the University of Western Australia, and Sari K. Ishii from Rikkyo University in Japan. Su-Lin Yu is the first director of an NCKU-backed project to attend the WUN. She expressed gratitude for the opportunity to undertake this important work, and conveyed hope that countries from around the world would be able to respect each other’s differences and learn from one another.
Su-Lin Yu recalled past advertisements for foreign brides in Taiwan, especially those for Vietnamese brides: “Vietnamese brides are charming, innocent, pretty and only NT$250,000.” When one side of a cross-national marriage is disadvantaged, marital conflicts and even domestic violence are often the end result. Drawing from Anna W. Tang’s book Frail Lotus, Yu points out that marriage migrants often have to shoulder the burdens of the home and various other hardships. Many are oppressed and restrained by their dependence on their husband’s family. Many end up being deported on grounds of failing to give birth to a son or failure to meet their in-laws’ arbitrary expectations. Some of these marriage migrants are even pressured to sleep with their father-in-laws.
“There’s one woman from Cambodia who married into a Taiwanese family. They lived in the remote countryside. After her husband passed away from an illness, her in-laws treated her like an insane person because she wasn’t able to acclimate to their lifestyle and couldn’t communicate due to the language barrier. They considered having her carted off to a psychiatric ward, or forcing her into a marriage with someone else. Her situation was a very dire one.” Le-kun Tan, a member of the “Marriage Migrants in Asia” project and a specialist in research related to language communication, pointed out that Cambodia is actually a country with mixed languages and cultures. When this Cambodian woman was isolated in a remote rural area, she had little opportunity to interact with and understand wider society in Taiwan. She became trapped in a difficult situation. Sadly, these types of cases are all too common.
It’s not all doom and gloom for marriage migrants, however. In recent years, there have been some inspiring cases of marriage migrants who were able to turn their lives around. For instance, Su-Lin Yu recalls the story of famous Vietnamese director Kim Hong Nguyen: “She came to Taiwan and married into a Taiwanese family when she was 21 years old. After suffering domestic abuse for many years, she plucked up her courage and ended her torturous marriage. She took her son with her, found part-time work, and lived a life of hardship for many years. Her second marriage to Tsung-lung Tsai, also a director, was the light at the end of the tunnel. With his support, Nguyen was able to produce a documentary called ‘Out/Marriage’ about the lives of her fellow marriage migrants. She no longer feels like she is disadvantaged and in need of others’ pity. Today, she’s a beautiful, independent, confident, and free woman. She’s an admirable individual.”
Su-Lin Yu is especially grateful to Chen Yuh-Neu, the dean of NCKU’s College of Liberal Arts, for her unflagging support of the “Marriage Migrants in Asia” project. The project team is aiming to complete an academic book by the end of 2018. They hope that their efforts will effect positive change in society and ameliorate public preconceptions and misconceptions of marriage migrants. Project-related workshops will be conducted at both NCKU and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. NCKU will also hold lectures and special talks by members of the project, and open up channels of exchange with NCKU students and faculty on gender-related research. The “Marriage Migrants in Asia” project is estimated to conclude in one year’s time, but those involved have already agreed to continue their collaboration on other research projects after this project has ended.
Founded on the cusp of the 21st century, the Worldwide Universities Network comprises 23 research-intensive universities across six continents. The alliance exists to pursue solutions to major global issues such as global warming, public health, global higher education and research, and cultural awareness, among others. In 2016, NCKU became the first university from Taiwan to join WUN. The WUN actively invites annual project proposals from member universities. WUN projects must involve three WUN member universities that represent at least two countries.
成功大學以「Marriage Migrants in Asia（亞洲婚姻移民）」計畫，在去年底成為台灣唯一加入世界大學聯盟 Worldwide Universities Network（WUN）的學校，10月5日舉辦國際工作坊展現成果，包括香港、日本、澳洲等地專家學者分享研究心得，還有多位新移民女性、NGO 代表參與討論，社會局、民政局皆派代表到場致意。計畫主持人游素玲教授表示，「此次工作坊所提供重要的見解，將成為政府制定相關政策的依據。」
成大蘇慧貞校長對團隊教授的努力表示感謝，她指出，在台灣有超過50萬婚姻移民婦女，每一位都是未來台灣之子的母親，透過調查及研究可以看到過去、現在跟未來的連結，將能了解文化之間的異同，並推動社會改變的價值，促進經濟發展，「不只對成大，也對整個台灣有重要的價值。」她也簡介成大是因應工業革命，協助社會轉型而建立的高等教育學校，過去一直被認為強調理工領域發展，這個WUN計畫讓外界看到成大對人文學科方面的重視。
成大性別與婦女研究中心教授游素玲特別安排會前播放影片，「Our Story」述說研究團隊如何跨國串聯、如何計畫，並且被列為 2018 年 14 個全球最具影響力的計畫案之一；「Their Stories」則呈現學生訪談亞洲婚姻移民女性的成果。游素玲認為，此次工作坊匯聚國際專家學者從各個面向切入，更是讓「我們」和「她們」真正交會，她也述說自己最大的心願，就是「希望她們的故事能被更多人看見，希望我們能持續為她們發聲。」
「亞洲婚姻移民國際工作坊」5 日上午 9 時開幕，進行3場研討共發表11篇論文，會中更進行圓桌會議，與新移民女性們深入交流。此次特別邀請長期在聯合國擔任人口和社會統計部主席的Prof. Keiko Osaki Tomita參與圓桌會議，她指出，聯合國全球契約於今年12月將會特別討論女性移民議題，台灣能在此刻針對此議題，有如此深入的討論，顯示台灣並未置身事外，積極與全球對話。
與會者包括來自西澳大學 Susan Broomhall 教授、Samina Yasmeen 教授、Loretta Baldassa 教授，來自日本的 Sachiko Yokota 教授、香港中文大學曾薰慧教授、香港教育大學杜維真教授。成大方面，則有計畫主持人外文系游素玲教授、教育所陸偉明教授、中文系蔡玫姿教授、歷史系蔡幸娟教授、體育健康休閒管理所徐珊惠教授、臺文系陳麗君教授，以及實踐大學高雄校區應用外語系劉開鈴教授等人。
其中，西澳學者 Samina Tasmeen 聚焦探討澳洲人的「伊斯蘭恐懼症」，提到自美國 911 恐攻事件之後，伊斯蘭恐慌氣氛也在澳洲升溫，雖相較於歐洲各國，特別是英國，澳洲的氛圍僅被認為是恐慌症初期，但隨著 2014 年 IS（伊斯蘭國）的興起，更強化了對伊斯蘭教與穆斯林的負面形象。然而，伊斯蘭恐慌症的升溫所帶來的影響中，女性更是不同於男性，受到的歧視情況更為嚴重。（撰文、攝影／朱怡婷）

5,gender-equality,Gender Re-Engineering Humanities Education,"This plan is co-executed by the NCKU College of Liberal Arts and the NCKU Center of Gender & Women Studies. Currently, there are four departments, two graduate institutes and three centers in the College of Liberal Arts of National Cheng Kung University including; the Department of Chinese Literature, Foreign Language and Literature Department, Department of History and the Department of Taiwanese Literature plus the Institute of Art Studies and the Institute of Archaeology. Additionally, there is the Chinese Language Center, Foreign Language Center and the Center of Multi-Culture Studies. The NCKU Center of Gender & Women Studies has been established for more than two decades and is composed by members of interdisciplinary college professors, mostly from the College of Liberal Arts. The purpose of the establishment is to focus on the development of gender awareness and research, to seek innovative ways of relaxing institutional rigidity, and to fulfill the value of altruistic care.
The Gender Re-Engineering Humanities Education plan is divided into three phases; (1) Dialogue between literary and cross-college professors, (2) summer lectures of Gender Re-Engineering Humanities Education Literature Reflection and Gender and Technology Study Groups, and (3) Cross-border / 1930 / Females Seminar and re-engineering ofπtype literary courses development (gender study program). The main executive unit of this plan is the NCKU Center of Gender & Women Studies, where professors and students of the College of Liberal Arts help to think about the core values of humanity studies. They will then form strategic alliances with the College of Engineering, the College of Medicine and the College of Planning and Design and integrate the humanistic social knowledge to the current industrial engineering. This permits the College of Liberal Arts and humanistic education to demonstrate interpretative functions and have their values highlighted. Gender awareness can be injected within so that the professors are able to possess a dynamic teaching mind with ways of applications. In this way, the students will become humanistic talents with macro, cutting-edge and gender views.

5,gender-equality,Women Mapping Anping,"Anping is the birthplace of Tainan and a representative epitome of Taiwan's development. The development of Anping was earlier than the development of the Capital City, or better put, the development of the Capital City was from Anping. Anping used to be the commercial port, the military port, and the fishing port. Today, it has become a modern metropolis that mesmerizes with beautiful scenery. This development is due to spatial configuration and the changes made due to the surrounding environment, over time. Based on the historical records, since the Ming Dynasty, the Anping has been under the rule of the Netherlands, the Ming Dynasty, the Qing Dynasty, the Japanese and the National Government (Lin Chao-chen and Zheng Shui-ping as Chief Editor, ""Anping District"" Vol. A, 5 – 6). In every historical development period, with the changes of political, economic, military and other factors, the population and spatial structure of Anping District changed significantly. After the Qianlong and Yongzheng Emperors, the population increased due to the military officers bringing their families with them. The population of different industries also increased and the social organizations transformed from the military to local governments (Zheng Shui-ping, 1998, 126). Between 1948 and 1949, the Joint Logistics Command of Shandong moved to Anping due to the relocation of the National Government, bringing the first wave of immigrants to the Anping District after the war (Zheng Shui-ping, 1998, 135). After 1990, the second wave of immigrants came to Anping due to the planning of the Fifth Redevelopment Area in Tainan (Zheng Shui-ping, 1998, 136). In this era of change, women who have moved in from other places, or women in the local area, including the first inhabitants, the Hoklo Taiwanese, Hakkas, Han Chinese, and new immigrant women who gradually emerged to support development of internationalization in Tainan. These contributions have not received the attention they deserve in current historical accounts. With the development of humanistic geographic narratives, the local annotation and research methods begun to be reshaped, and the place was reduced in the context of globalization. In fact, this is not entirely correct. First of all, in the fields of literature, history, anthropology, sociology, medicine, science, and technology, the concept of bottom-up history has gradually been developed. The concept of history itself is required to take into account both the vertical time-oriented and horizontal spatial orientated views in order to combine the topics under discussion and the contemporary cultural and historical issues, analyzing the influences caused by identity recognition under certain time and space with the different factors, like gender, class, nationality, and others. Secondly, in recent years, pushed by the large-scale projects such as the national community re-engineering policy, the localization policy, the reproduction of Zeelandia in Tainan City, and the Anping Port National Historical Scenic Area, the current research of Anping has become a subject of concern. However, in the current Anping study, there is no female-centered research, although women have had an important position in the development of Anping. Therefore, the idea of an integrative project has emerged. In the short span of 50 years, the historical trace of the indigenous residents, foreigners, mainlanders and new immigrant women at different time points can be seen everywhere in the Anping area. Although researchers are only observing by standing outside of the Anping time and landscapethey are able to see the emotional linkages between the people and place, making Anping a meaningful and experienced world.
In terms of Anping, the early research focuses on historical development, folklore and culture, cultural relic discovery and their introduction, while later research focuses on the investigation of traditional local society. Later, with the rise and promotion of community building concepts, research is primarily focused on architecture and space (streets) (seen in the Masters’ theses). In recent years, due to the rise of the cultural industry, the research direction tends to be tourism and community development. All of these studies cut in from the historical evolution or regional characteristics, enriching the aspects of Anping. Nevertheless, apart from being a region to be observed, studied and written, Anping can be a place worthy of attention and significant for exploration.
Being in a place, whether it is from the time or the spatial views, the fluid nature is indeed displayed. Its locality has always been shaped by the daily life of the mobile crowd. On the other hand, due to the dominance of the political regime, the place has been presented with different appearances and connotations in different eras. Anping used to be a hub of global trade. It was once the Zeelandia and once flourished and then fell. It now contains a complicated relationship with the past and with other regions, near or far. Departing from Anping, we should not just know of a place, but also develop a way to re-understand its connection to the world.
In this local study, it is not only hoped to take the local perspective of contemporary humanistic and geography in this interdisciplinary plan to re-understand how Anping acts as a place but also to outline Anping with the significantly necessary gender points of view in the current studies of Anping.  Furthermore, the Anping will become a way through which to re-understand the world, establish a dialogue with the other local studies in the world, and place Anping on the global landscape. Furthermore, the gender dimension will be reduced, placing Anping women’s feelings towards the place as the main axis and observing the social relationship of Anping with the past and amongst places.
安平是台南發跡之所在，也是台灣發展的代表性縮影。從空間的面向來看，安平的發展早於府城的發展，或說，府城的發展是從安平出發。從功能性來看，安平曾經是商港、軍港、漁港，到今日成為以觀光地景勝出的現代都會副都心，這樣的發展，不但緣於其自身空間配置及其與週邊環境之間的變化，也反映了時代的變遷。從歷史記載來看，自明朝以降，先後歷經荷蘭、明、清、日本、國民政府等政制（林朝成與鄭水萍主編，《安平區志》上冊，5-6）；在每一個歷史發展時期，隨著政治、經濟、軍事等因素的變化，安平區的人口與空間結構皆有顯著的變化。如清雍正乾隆以後，軍旅可攜眷前來，於是人口增加，商工漁業人口增加，社會組織也逐漸由軍隊而轉為以家庭、家族為主（鄭水萍，1998，126）。又如民國三十七年至三十八年之間，因國民政府遷台，而聯勤山東青島廠遷至安平，帶來戰後安平區第一批移民潮（鄭水萍，1998，135）；在民國七十九年以後，因為台南五期重劃區的規劃，促成安平區戰後第二波移民潮（鄭水萍，1998，136）。在這樣的時代變化中，由外地遷入的女性或是在地的女性，包括先住民、閩南人、客家人、漢人，還有在台南國際化的發展中漸漸湧現的新移民女性，她們的樣貌、行止等卻不曾在既有的歷史記述中得到應有的重視。
隨著人文地理論述的發展，地方的內涵與研究方法開始被重新形構，地方在全球化的情境下看似被縮小，但其實不然。首先，無論在文學、歷史學、人類學、社會學，甚至在醫學、科技史等領域裡，都漸漸發展由下而上的歷史觀；歷史觀本身更被要求要同時兼顧直線的時間面向與水平的空間面向，以便將討論的議題與當代的文化歷史議題結合，來解析性別、階級、國族等各個因素在某一特定時空下對身分認同所造成的影響。其次，近年來在全國社區再造政策、本土化政策、台南市「再現王城」、「安平港國家歷史風景區」等大型計畫的推波助興下，安平研究成為一個受到關切的主題。但是在目前的安平研究裡卻不見以女性為主體的研究，儘管女性在安平的發展裡有重要的地位。由是之故，乃有本整合計畫案構想之興起。在短短五十年間，安平地區處處可見先住民、外籍人士、外省人、新移民女性在不同時間點所留下的歷史痕跡。我們原本是站在安平地景之外的研究者，不過，隨著觀看與融入，我們看見了人與地方之間的情感關連，安平成為有意義和可經驗的世界。
針對安平，早年的研究重點為歷史發展、民俗與文化、文物發現與介紹，近於傳統方志的考察；其後隨著社區營造概念的興起與推動，研究以建築與空間（街道）（尤見於碩士論文）為主；近年來由於文化產業的興起，研究方向則趨於觀光與社區發展。這些研究從歷史的沿革或區域的特性切入，豐富了安平的面貌；不過，我們以為安平除了是一個可以被觀看、研究和書寫的區域外，更有其做為一個地方，值得關注和探討的意義。
做為一個地方，安平無論從時間或空間發展的面向而言，皆呈現流動不拘的特性。它的地方性一方面經由移動人群的日常生活操演而總在型塑之中，另一方面則由於政治政權體制的主導，而在不同時代呈現不同面貌與內涵。安平曾是全球貿易往來的轉口據點，曾是王城，曾經興盛，曾經沒落，它的現在其實蘊藏著它與過去、與其他或近或遠的地方曾有的複雜關係，由安平出發，我們可以認識的不只是安平這個地方，也可由此發展出重新認識世界的方式。
在此地方研究中，本跨領域規劃案不僅希望以當代人文地理學地方研究的角度出發，重新認識安平如何做為一個地方，更要以目前安平研究中十分需要的性別觀點來重新勾勒安平地方，更進一步地，我們將以安平地方做為認識世界的方式，與全球其它地方研究對話，在全球地景上，安置安平。亦即，我們將以性別向度切入，以安平婦女對地方的感受為主軸，勘察安平地方與過去及其與其它地方的社會關係。

5,gender-equality,Successful Women’s Silhouette,"The history of National Cheng Kung University exhibits a strong background in science and engineering. The school regulations of 1934 stated: ""To provide the necessary higher education for males who are engaged in industry and to train them to become useful figures for the country.” This indeed recognizes NCKU’s core of cultivating males during the school’s development and atmosphere in the past. However, changes occurred after the 228 Event in 1947 in response to this event. In addition to the admission of female students, female professors were recruited to the campus. In response to the increase of the female members, female related space specifications on the campus were constructed which promoted female participation in campus public affairs.
Based on the significant influences of women’s participation in the social and administrative development, this plan intends to understand the history of women’s participation in campus administration during 84 years of NCKU history. The historical trajectory of women's participation in public administration from the development of NCKU and social women's rights and interests will be researched. Digital technology development promoted social reflection on gender through gender-related knowledge construction and dissemination. Gender based culture is promoted by multiple media sources including the internet, movies, books, digital databases, and online communities. Therefore, digital technology development is not only about preserving the history of gender development in the past, but also provides a way to create a new philosophy for the future gender culture of Taiwanese society. This can be accomplished through the construction and dissemination of digital media. Thus, this plan aims to preserve the history of women’s participation in the public administration of NCKU campus through gender database construction. With this, the importance of women in campus development can be cogitated on, and analyze the gender cultural changes throughout the years from a rational perspective.
Simultaneously, the community may be able to learn about the unique significances of each of the female professors on the campus with touching biographical stories. Then, by combining the two perspectives, the different perspectives of the females' endeavors can be outlined. Under the developmental changes of the Taiwanese society, we can ponder the gender cultural development on the campus and in Taiwanese society of the past eighty years, and discover additional assistance and development for women who participate in public administration.

回顧成大的歷史，由於成大是以理工學院為背景的大學，且1934年的校規定定說明：「對於從事工業之男性施以所需要的高等教育，鍊成國家有用之人物為目的。」表彰了成大過去以培養男性做為校園發展與風氣的核心。然此現象在1947年的228事件之後發生改變，不僅女性學生獲准入學，校園亦開始聘用女性教師，而校園因應女性成員的增加，因此在軟硬體設備上開始建置與女性相關的空間規範，也進一步促使女性參與校園公共事務。本計劃的目的是基於台灣社會與成大校園發展的歷史當中，女性參與行政的社會發展脈絡之下的交互影響，意圖了解成大84年以來的歷史當中女性參與校園行政的歷史，並試圖從成大的發展與社會女性權益的發展脈絡之下，了解女性參與公共行政的歷史軌跡。 而在數位科技的發展之下，性別相關的知識傳播與建構亦推動了社會對於性別的反思。所有的網際網路、數位資料庫、網路社群，無一不與性別文化產生關聯性，因此數位化的科技發展，不僅只於保存過去的性別發展歷史，也可以通過這些資料庫的建構與傳播，思索台灣社會未來的性別文化可以如何再開創出新的局面。因此本計劃意圖經由性別數據的建置，保存成大校園女性參與公共行政的歷史，藉以思考女性在校園發展當中具有何種的重要性，並從理性的角度分析歷年來的性別文化變遷，同時也從感性的人物故事了解每一位女性教師在校園當中所具有的獨特意義，並將兩者結合，勾勒出女性奮鬥的異同面向。再與台灣社會此一大環境的發展變遷下，思索八十餘年來的校園與台灣社會的性別文化發展，並進一步思索關於女性參與公共行政方面，還能夠有何種的協助與發展。計畫網站 http://rlsrl.pehl.ncku.edu.tw/

成大全校佔地面積一百八十公頃，光是校本部七個校區就有八十公頃之多，除了教學、研究、行政大樓以及道路之外，整個校區絕大部分都是蒼翠樹木和綠草覆蓋的草坪。面對廣大草坪及樹木需要大量水灌溉的窘境，成大特別選在一些大樓或公共設施中設置雨廢水處理所，以滴水不漏方式回收所有雨水和生活廢水，作為澆灑花草樹木之用。成大這項巧思與創意，除了可以省水資源、省水費，也可以達到教育的功能。
成大總務處表示，全校共設置八個雨廢水處理所，包括光復校區的雲平大樓地下室、管理學院地下室、學生活動中心地下室、中文系館地下室、修齊大樓地下室、光復校區通往成功校區的勝利路地下道、自強校區的地下停車場地下室、敬業校區敬二舍地下室等，這八個雨廢水處理所每天所收取的雨廢水已經足夠灌溉全校的花草樹木，不太需要用自來水。
各雨廢水處理所的水量，以勝利路地下道的水量最為豐沛，其次是雲平大樓地下室雨水廢水處理所。成大對於所收集的雨廢水都充分地加以利用；以勝利路地下道的雨水廢水處理所為例，它每天的出水量約有五十萬噸，除了提供成功校區一般的澆灑花草樹木外，剩餘的水全部引到成功湖儲存起來備用，需要時再從成功湖抽出來灌溉鄰近的草坪或樹木。由於成大雨水廢水處理所所收集的廢水僅為雨水與生活廢水，不包含化糞池的污水，因此水質非常適合拿來灌溉花草樹木。

The seminar was held online though video calls because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and scholars from various countries including Taiwan, the United States, Australia, the Philippines, and Indonesia were invited. NCKU President Huey-Jen Jenny Su also participated. Su boosted morale and delivered cakes and snacks to overseas scholars and experts through Uber Eats for all participants to enjoy, a move that surprised and amazed overseas participants.
In 2015, the United Nations established 17 SDGs to lead the world in its vision and action for the future. In April 2020, the World University Impact Ranking released by Times Higher Education ranked NCKU 2nd in Asia and 38th in the world. By adopting the SDGs as institutional development goals and sustainable development concepts as the core for industrial development, NCKU developed abundant research energy and obtained fruitful research results. Furthermore, the university increased application of intramural resources to enhance its global impact and achieve the NCKU 2030 Vision.
Tsair-Fuh Lin, Director of the Office of Research and Development, conveyed that the six-day seminar was focused on UN SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. NCKU has collaborated with many research and global institutions to develop this field. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the seminar was held online through video calls. It was attended by over 70 experts from Taiwan, the United States, Australia, the Philippines, and Indonesia as well as a combination of over 30 NCKU instructors and students. The seminar mainly discussed research developments in water quality and health-related issues and allowed participants to share experiences from their own country.
Lin pointed out that due to the pandemic, seminar participants could not convene and make in-person exchanges. Therefore, President Su used the Uber Eats platform to deliver food to the home or meeting venue of online participants during breaktime. This enabled the participants to eat snacks and chat while enjoying a novel conference format.
During the break, students took out slider burgers and cakes to dine with scholars and participants thousands of miles away through video call. The scholars said that the arrangements made by NCKU were thoughtful.
Yi-Ting Chen, a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of Environmental Engineering, said that NCKU’s method to deliver snacks was very creative. Again, seminar participants couldn’t convene in person due to the pandemic. Through technology, participants were able to hold the meeting online and order food online to share, thereby creating a unique experience. Chen also stated that the online seminar enabled the participation of participants who were originally unable to attend, and thereby closed the distance for the exchange and sharing of information and experiences.

6,clean-water-and-sanitation,NCKU’s University Social Responsibility Coastal Project Team Helps Fishers Overcome Climate Change by Using New Water-Quality-Monitoring Technology,"The university social responsibility (USR) coastal project team of National Cheng Kung University’s (NCKU) has established a water-quality-monitoring system in cooperation with aquafarmers in Qigu to resolve the problem of sudden clam and oyster death caused by climate-change-induced water quality changes. Of all the teams working on the Implementation Plan Adapted to Environmental Change in Tainan Coastal Area (IMPACT), Professor Chang Chih-Hua of the Department of Environmental Engineering, NCKU, and his team in the laboratory of smart monitoring for water quality have developed a simple water-quality-monitoring system. This system employs the Internet of Things (IoT) to upload water-quality-monitoring data to the cloud, enabling the team to monitor water quality in the Qigu aquaculture area in real time and propose adjustment suggestions for  areas in which water quality is easily affected.
Since May 2019, Dr. Lee Nian-Shyun of the Department of Environmental Engineering, NCKU—who is the IMPACT team member in charge of cooperation—has organized numerous forums on Taijian aquaculture water quality monitoring in Qigu area in order to understand the local aquaculture problems related to water quality. In addition, the IMPACT team has explained the impact of rainfall and water salinity on aquaculture and established plans for water-quality-monitoring system, explaining these systems to local fishers in the forums. Furthermore, the team has been able to understand the problems faced by local fishers, the scope of relevant impacts, and other needs of the local fishers.
Climate change has had a strong influence on aquaculture; for example, high rainfall intensity has caused drastic changes in water quality, and global warming has caused extreme changes in water temperature. Although fishers and companies have attempted to use water-quality-monitoring equipment to conduct monitor water quality in fish farms and various types of water-quality-monitoring equipment are commercially available, the application of such equipment to aquaculture remains relatively unpopular. The main reasons are as follows: 1) Monitoring equipment is too expensive. Basic water-quality-monitoring equipment costs at least NT$100,000, and each fish farm requires at least one set of equipment, which is unaffordable for ordinary aquafarmers.
2) The coastal environment is harsh for water-quality-monitoring equipment. Fine electronic components are extremely vulnerable to humidity and salinity. The maintenance and correction of instruments are required to ensure the reliability and robustness of monitoring data; however, maintenance requires yet more money.
3) Aquafarmers are generally older and tend to rely on their aquaculture experience rather than innovative technologies. In addition, these farmers have limited knowledge of the relationship between water quality factors and aquaculture. Thus, increasing the popularity of water-quality-monitoring systems and the coverage of the IoT for water quality monitoring are the main challenges for the team.
In response to the aforementioned problems, the IMPACT team designed a simple innovative water-quality-monitoring system for use in aquaculture. According to Dr. Lee, in addition to being inexpensive, being easy to install, and enabling monitoring of multiple water quality parameters, this low-cost system can be widely installed in the aquaculture area in Qigu to form a water-quality-monitoring network. IoT technology can be used to upload water-quality-monitoring data obtained by this network. In addition to enabling real-time monitoring of water quality in the Qigu area, the uploaded data can be used to make suggestions of areas that are likely to be affected by water quality changes. Water quality models and big data analysis can be employed to predict water quality changes in the area to raise a warning before a change occurs. Additionally, the water-quality-monitoring equipment developed by the team is considerably cheaper than that currently available. Therefore, fishers who wish to participate in the water-quality-monitoring network or simply install the system in their fish farm will have an affordable option. The low cost may also increase their willingness to install the system.
Regarding the goal of the project, Professor Lin Tzu-Ping from the Department of Architecture, NCKU, indicated that the team hoped each USR project would be based on the premise of easy construction and affordability, so that fishers can comfortably improve their working environment to increase revenue. In the process of cooperation, the IMPACT team has conducted multiple discussions with the fishers about the practicality of the facility and the monitoring factors that will meet the fishers’ needs. The success of this project would enable fishers to promote and develop the technology in multiple respects and enable application of this technology in other regions. The long-term goal of the project is to establish a big data database to propose adaptation and improvement suggestions regarding storm-induced disasters. These suggestions would reduce the risks posed by the climate to local aquaculture and achieve the goal of economic, social, and environmental sustainability.
The IMPACT project is a 2018 USR project subsidized by the Ministry of Education and involves the collaboration of Professor Lin Tzu-Ping (Department of Architecture), Associate Professor Chang Yi (Department of Hydraulic and Ocean Engineering), Assistant Professor Huang Tai-Lin (Department of Urban Planning), Associate Director Chiang Wen-Shan (Tainan Hydraulics Laboratory), and Associate Professor Hsueh Cheng-Luen (Department of Architecture). Professor Rau Jiann-Yeou from the Department of Geomatics helped with the aerial photography of coastal and community areas and the construction of three-dimensional models. The aim of the IMPACT project is to explore the problems that arise in the coastal area of Tainan, to nurture the local environment and students’ awareness of social issues—leading students to help local communities in the coastal area to adapt to climate change—and to proactively implement the sustainable development goals proposed by the United Nations to meet the international standards and thus fulfill the social responsibilities of NCKU.

6,clean-water-and-sanitation,"Sarva Mangala Praveena：Do What You Love, Love What You Do","Dr. Sarva Mangala Praveena receives the 2018 Gro Brundtland Week of Women in Sustainable Development from Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Tang Prize Foundation and NCUK President Huey-Jen Jenny Su at NCKU, April 3rd.
Endorsed by Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, granted by Tang Prize Foundation and organized by NCKU, the Gro Brundtland Week of Women in Sustainable Development commits to engage the outstanding female researchers for public health and sustainable development. It empowers an international platform for collaboration and partnership of female researchers in Taiwan and developing countries.
Dr. Praveena says, “This award means recognition and appreciation for my research work achievements, for the job that I love and passionate till today.” Dr. Praveena is the associate professor of Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University Putra Malaysia, specialized in environmental analysis and human health risk assessment.
Research Highlights
Dr. Praveena’s research topics were related with environmental analysis and human health risk assessment, involving various types of water samples (beach water, drinking water, surface water and wastewater, low cost water filter), urban soil and dust, marketed rice and microbeads.
Her water-related research topics include the health symptoms among beach visitors due to beach water exposure, heavy metal in drinking water incorporated with health risk assessment. Some of her research findings provide baseline values to broaden current knowledge of emerging pollutant (steroid hormones) contamination in water bodies in Malaysia. Her greywater purification study shows heavy metal (Cu, Cd, Pb and Ni) can be removed with banana stem waste, exploring its great potential as a raw material for activated carbon production and greywater treatment.
Dr. Praveena also points out the importance to consider bioavailability pollutant form as accurate pollutant concentration in health risk assessment for future study, with her studies involving soil and dust in urban areas. Her microbeads study findings have outlined as an indicator on global occurrence of microplastics pollution due to personal care products, which is limited, found in Southeast Asia.
Dr. Praveena is also the inventor of a water filtration unit, low cost, foldable, easy to transport and assemble. It uses silver nanoparticles coating on cellulose paper to filter and provide clean drinking water and the performance efficacy scores for six sustainability criteria, suitable for emergency use. SODIS and chlorination are suitable for emergency use, but their dependence on UV penetration and chlorine disinfection efficiency would be an issue. Comparatively, the filters made with ceramic and biosand would suit for daily use with higher performance index, but it will decline if regular cleaning is not in place.
“Rapid urbanization will increase the pollution loadings.” Dr. Praveena concludes. “Assuring safe drinking-water from sustainable water resources is one of the crucial factors in public health and sustainable development to every country in the world.”
Dr. Praveena notes, to all those women who would like to pursue your career in field of science, “having a career as a female scientist is full of challenges, thus you need to love what you do, open for learning new things every day, face all the challenges and push yourself outside of your comfort zone. Enjoy small and also big achievements in your career, this will increase your confidence level. Lastly, you have to work really hard. It is because at the end of the day, nothing can beat the hard work in order to be successful in your career.”
來自馬來西亞的Sarva Mangala Praveena博士，是Putra Malaysia大學環境與職業醫學研究所副教授，多年來，她透過環境分析與健康風險評估，探討永續發展與公共衛生相關議題，獲選2018年Gro Brundtland Award。她現正進行污水淨化、飲用水藥物殘留分析等研究，並開發出低成本、適合緊急使用的飲用水淨水器。
Dr. Praveena 認為，不論是開發中國家或開發國家，公共衛生是永續發展的核心，其中最關鍵的是飲用水的水資源永續發展，馬來西亞的水資源面臨污水、工業廢水、氣候變遷等威脅。她曾經針對被馬國做為飲用水水源的3條河流進行水質檢測分析，結果檢測到多種藥物殘留（阿莫西林、咖啡因、氯黴素、環丙沙星等），確定在馬國水體中出現新的污染物，這些研究結果擴充了馬來西亞對新型污染的認知與掌握。另外，她也做過海水浴場、一般廢水、飲用水等各式水質檢測研究，發現充滿戲水人潮的海水早已被污染。至於土壤、粉塵、稻米、奈米塑膠微粒等環境污染與健康的相關議題也在她的研究範疇之中。
Dr. Praveena只做研究，她嘗試以纖維紙為素材，成功開發出物美價廉的奈米銀離子飲用水淨水器原型，成本低、輕便、可折疊，可在短時間內過濾雨水等低濁度水，獲得乾淨飲用水的Emerg奈米淨水器，主要希望在地震、淹水等天災時發揮作用，讓民眾在緊急狀況下迅速便利得到乾淨飲用水。
獲得2018年Gro Brundtland Award，Dr. Praveena興奮地說，「我熱愛我的研究，研究成果果及其影響一直持續中，得獎不只是榮譽，更是對我投入研究成績的肯定。」
Dr. Praveena表示，能夠有今天的榮耀，要感謝所有合作過的研究夥伴，也謝謝多位主管給她發揮的機會。「最要謝謝的是父母親，尤其是我的母親，她堅信女性受教育是一件重要的事，也教導我要堅強面對任何挑戰，這是我做任何研究，能有源源不絕動力的關鍵。」
Dr. Praveena認為，馬來西亞在教育上並沒有性別偏見，對於有意從事科學研究的女性，提供相同機會，讓她們去證實自己是一位優秀的科學家。目前政府更關心的是，提升孩童對數學以及科學興趣。
處在學術殿堂，身肩研究與學術責任，同時也是人妻人母，Dr. Praveena表示，要在不同的角色中取得平衡，是很大的挑戰與壓力，需要很大的毅力與堅持。人生難免遇到挑戰，要去面對與克服，才可能實現目標。她期許有意走上科學研究道路的年輕學子，唯有熱愛科學研究，願意學習新事物的態度，才能在面對眾多挑戰與困境之際，勇敢踏出舒適圈，得到收穫進而獲得大成就，不論如何，努力是一定要的，得到成功的要領就是努力再努力。

6,clean-water-and-sanitation,NCKU students Propose Plans to Fix Underpass Flooding Problem,"Heavy rain causing flooded roadways is a travel headache for residents living in the neighborhood of the Xiao-Dong Underpass in Tainan City. A group of students led by Professor Hsiao-Wen Wang tried to tackle the problem and proposed possible solutions to it.
The course is named Lowland Flooding and Management which is opened for students taking the International Master Program on Natural Hazards Mitigation and Management at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), Tainan, Taiwan.
After months of investigation and experiments, the students shared their research and proposed solutions to the problem at a recent presentation attended by professors, experts and officials from Tainan City government.
A total of 23 local and international students are divided into five groups to explore the issues behind the flooding.
One of the five teams proposed short-term solutions include portable pumping system of the onset flooding, safety drill, by passing the traffic and information processing by the media.
Another team’s short-term plan is to detours while mid-term is to build green infrastructure and long-term is to re-design drainage system.
“All the proposed ideas are practical and feasible. We will have our proposed solutions come true as part of the policy in the near future,” said Prof. Wang from the Department of Hydraulic and Ocean Engineering.
Mr. Shao-Bo Peng, Deputy Director of Water Resource Bureau in Tainan City Government said that he is happy to see such a great course at NCKU and appreciate all the efforts made by the students and teachers.
Mr. Shu-Hsu Wu also from Tainan City Government said, “Prof. Wang’s course is very practical and inspiring. In this course, students deal with real problems. In the past two to three months, students started to figure out the problem and come up with some good solutions today.”
This course involves the understanding of spatial planning, vulnerability, risk, and resilience to the problem of lowland flooding, according to Prof. Wang.
It emphasizes more on the systemic understanding that should underlie lowland flooding management and seeks to address issues from a holistic perspective, rather than traditional on-site structure-oriented strategies, she added.
台南小東路地下道，讓用路的人與車不受鐵路平交道影響，卻也洐生出豪大雨積水，甚至人、車行不得的交通困擾；成功大學水利及海洋工程學系修習「低地洪災管理」課程的學生們，經由實勘、實驗後提出包括設LED警示、增設側溝蓋、排水溝以及引流等短、中長期改善構想等建設性措施，受專家肯定，認為學生的提案可作未來改善小東地下道逢豪雨必淹的重要參考價值。
水利系王筱雯副教授認為，教學不應脫離日常生活經驗，「低地洪災管理」課程，即以距成大最近、每逢豪大雨即淹水的小東地下道的積水問題，讓學生製作專題，使學生走出教室去探究問題，再提出可行的改善策略。
為避免學生提的規劃案過於理想，學期期間，王筱雯副教授多次邀請市政府水利局官員、業界專家等到課堂與學生座談，給予實務面意見，期末發表時並請水利局、業界人士擔任作品評審。
水利局副局長彭紹博等評審非常肯定成大學生對小東地下道的關注與設法改善的用心。學生從一開始無法發現問題根源到能提出完善的解決方案，過程非常不容易，有些提案足可做為改善小東地下道的重要參考。評審也提醒學生，重視基礎分析、基本資料，融入多方觀點，才能讓提案或規劃更為周全。
共23名國內外學生分成5組，經過一學期的實勘、實驗與辨證，5組學生分別提出改善方案，短、中、長期規劃都有，其中不乏可行性頗高的策略。
第5組的彭佩斯、游佳靜、黃孟璇、Lam Nguyen 、Adrienne Dodd等，提出的短期規劃為，於鄰近小東地下道的大馬路口設置LED警示燈，當降雨導致淹水，警示燈即閃爍，提醒用路人車淹水與改道。中程規劃，增加地下道與排水道的通水斷面。長期規劃，設置透水舖面。
第1組的Jose Elias 、Barahona、Fernando Mixco、Pavel Bratsky、楊琮鈞、蔡維哲等指出，小東地下道淹水原因為，水溝蓋加蓋減少滲流面積、側溝通水斷面不足所致，提出增側溝面積、增加排水溝數量等規劃。
第2組的陳筱惟、翁傑軒、Ersnt Fiefie、Laxman Maharjan、Ferdian Susanto規劃的長期目標，將小東地下道的積水排入鄰近台南公園的燕潭。短期方案為，媒體傳播警示、洪水警示與抽水系統。
第3組的劉佳運、陳冠維、蕭婷予的提案包括，增設截流溝、加設排水箱涵將截溝的水排至附近其他箱涵。利用台南公園燕潭作為滯洪池。
第4組梁瑋茜、陳崇賢、林瑋佑、Clara、John提出設透水舖面的方案，以減緩小東地下道淹水。

7,affordable-and-clean-energy,7.2.1 Energy-efficient renovation and building,"NCKU has a policy ensuring all renovation and new builds are falling energy efficiency standards. We have set up the Energy Conservation Promotion Committee since 2008. The committee’s strategy involves the following regulations: new buildings must comply with energy efficiency standards and existing buildings should be improved in terms of energy efficiency. The Committee also aims to reduce CO2 emissions, promote water reuse as well as energy management and utilization of renewable energy. Furthemore, the committee holds 2 meetings annually to review three main types of energy used within the university: electric power, thermal energy, and building energy (water resources). The meeting not only aims to analyze energy usage and development, but also to discuss incentives measures for energy saving.
As such, since 2018, NCKU has been replacing old air conditioners with energy class 1 or 2 air conditioners. 620 air conditioners have been replaced by now in 2021, saving 540,020 kWh of electricity, which is 0.78% less than the electricity consumption in 2020. Moreover, four buildings on the campus have been rewarded with the Silver Class Green Buildings (EEWH Green Building Certification), during 2018-2020. In Addition, in 2020, the Energy Conservation Promotion Committee has decided to incorporate EAC and EL standards into the contract for design and planning of new buildings on campus in the future.

NCKU Commitment on Carbon-intensive Energy Industries Divestment
In response to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and 13 (Climate Action), NCKU is committed to divesting carbon-intensive industries. Although NCKU Endowment Fund currently invests only 2.7% in petrochemical industries, we will not increase our investment in the said industries and will divest from them when the opportunity arises.
To fulfill our university social responsibility, we have established a sustainable investment policy (SIP) integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into Endowment Fund investment analysis and decision-making processes. Regarding our investment portfolio, we prioritize enterprises that are included in the corporate social responsibility (CSR) ranking and/or have participated in international climate initiatives. For realising our Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), without impacting the Endowment Fund, we will not invest or increase our share in companies that are involved in serious CSR violations.
As a university measures towards affordable clean energy policy, NCKU have focused on divesting investments by gradually reducing the investments in carbon-intensive energy industries. Also, NCKU established an industry-university alliance to fundamentally promote industrial transformation, combining industry practice and study experience. Besides, The Magic School of Green Technologies in NCKU, the first zero-energy building in Taiwan, is considered as the educational base of eco-friendly.

7,affordable-and-clean-energy,NCKU Holds Seminar on Sustainable Development Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy,"On November 14, National Cheng Kung University’s Office of Research and Development collaborated with the NCKU Research Center for Energy Technology and Strategy and the Hierarchical Green-Energy Materials (Hi-GEM) Research Center to hold a seminar on Sustainable Development Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. Scholars and experts were invited to share their research and discuss a variety of topics, including energy resource circulation, energy resource education, industry–academy collaboration, smart energy, and energy-saving systems.
Tsair-Fuh Lin, Director of the Office of Research and Development, noted that in 2015, the United Nations announced 17 Sustainable Development Goals. In April 2020, the World University Impact Ranking released by Times Higher Education ranked NCKU as 2nd in Asia and 38th worldwide. Of the 17 SDGs, NCKU was ranked top 100 in 11 goals. By using the SDGs as institutional development goals and sustainable development concepts as the core objectives for industrial development, NCKU has generated abundant research energy and obtained fruitful research results. In addition, the university has increased the investment of intramural resources to enhance its global influence and achieve the NCKU 2030 Vision.
The Hi-GEM Research Center, one of the seminar organizers, was established in 2008 and became a top university research center in 2011. Hi-GEM Director Ta-Hui Lin stated that Hi-GEM’s research capacity currently leads Taiwan in the following fields: (1) monitoring and maintenance of offshore wind farms; (2) flexi-fuel technology for energy saving and emissions reduction; (3) smart energy grid and energy storage; and (4) energy resources and policies. After the Aim for the Top University Project concluded, the research center continued operation using funding granted for other research projects to achieve financial autonomy. In the future, the center will cooperate with national energy transition policies and endeavor to become an internationally recognized research center.
The flexi-fuel team of the Hi-GEM Research Center presented its developed flexi-fuel technology for energy saving and emission reduction, including material and source classification, preprocessing, basic combustion analysis, industrial-grade burning test analysis, and fly-ash reuse. The team constructed Taiwan’s first 100 kW-grade oxy-combustion research furnace, which combusts solid and liquid fuel under pure oxygen conditions. Over 90% of the flue gas of this furnace is CO2. Recently, the flexi-fuel team has collaborated with the Industrial Technology Research Institute Green Energy and Environment Research Laboratories to construct a low-carbon energy and resource circulation science-based industrial park and create Taiwan’s first 600 kW dual-circulation fluidized bed power generation platform. Equipped with various technologies and equipment for testing fuel and combustion characteristics, the flexi-fuel team supports manufacturers in developing and testing various fuels and collaborates with furnace manufacturers by providing furnace sample designs, analyzing furnace parameters, and constructing systems for entire plants.
The circular economy team shared its contributions in various recycle and reuse technologies developed for circular resources and materials since 2017. The team assists domestic stainless-steel production index companies in achieving production goals, in enhancing the quality of generated furnace slag for reuse, in modifying the refining process, in flame resistance testing, in obtaining international certificates with products, and in integrating the industry chain. The team has established the Diverse Resource and Material Joint Research and Development Center to facilitate collaboration between NCKU and the US company Applied Environmental Technologies, Inc. The collaboration project used an academic approach to create a novel plastic waste recycling mechanism, and the circular economy team has applied the developed mechanism for international certification as the first closed recycling system for plastic products in the world.
Director Lin observed that since 2018, the Hi-GEM Research Center has implemented the Talent Cultivation for the Integration and Application of Clean Energy System, a program set up by the Ministry of Education. Due to Taiwan’s shortage of energy resources and inability to rely on single energy resources, the future trend of energy consumption will orient toward small quantities of reusable resources, or highly volatile reusable energy resources, diversified and regional energy applications. To anticipate this trend, the cultivation and training of energy system integration talents is necessary. To this end, the program connects with United Nation SDG 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. It both advocates for the regional implementation of education for energy system integration talent cultivation and industry–academy collaboration and proactively invites collaboration between industry, government, and academic sectors. The program is planned to end in February 2021, to establish 11 cultivation bases, and to cultivate highly demanded talents in the energy sector through the cultivation bases and training courses on professional energy technologies.
Hong-Tzer Yang, a distinguished professor of the Department of Electrical Engineering and a deputy director of the Hi-GEM Research Center, shared the goals of Taiwan’s energy development policies and introduced the power market system and infrastructure planning. Yang proposed using user-end demand side management–related information, such as demand response and demand bidding, and operation plans that facilitate the service trade market as references for the optimization of distributed energy resources in energy management systems to obtain maximum efficiency. Key technology applications used in the development of user-end power management systems include smart community power management system frameworks, renewable energy generation forecasting, optimization, demand response, human¬ machine interfaces, blockchain distributed ledgers, smart contracts, and nonintrusive load monitoring systems. In particular, Yang’s research used the power management system located in Area C of the Shalun Smart Green Energy Science Park.
The Hi-GEM Research Center’s offshore wind farm observation and maintenance team is among Taiwan’s few wind farm maintenance teams and has five years of experience. The team is equipped the world’s first commercialized floating light detecting and ranging device. In addition to employing mobile monitoring technology using this device, the team collaborated with the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands to introduce the European offshore meteorological mast technology and operation experience. The Hi-GEM Multifunction Building Design Team introduced how testing platforms for energy conservation buildings are designed, presented concepts on digital twin technology, and shared their current platform testing results and the application integration framework for digital twin technology to provide a reference for future system development.
To end the seminar, the Hi-GEM research team lead by Professor Chuan-Pu Liu introduced a recent production technology for nano-silica powder and research on its applications. The presented research outcomes included application of nano-silica powder as the anode material in lithium-ion batteries, carbon-silica powder, and hydrogen production fuel cells, thereby demonstrating the potential of nano-silica powder in energy-related applications. Subsequently, Associate Professor Wen-Dung Hsu shared a novel artificial intelligence smart technology—applying materials genome engineering to support green energy material design. Hsu’s presentation, entitled “Application of Computational Materials Science in Advanced Secondary Batteries,” shared the development and research results of high-pressure electrolyte, a topic highly anticipated in the industrial field. Chia-Chin Chang, Director of the Research and Development Center for Lithium-ion Battery and Dean of the College of Environmental Sciences and Ecology, National University of Tainan, delivered a presentation entitled “Development of Microgrid Chemistry Energy Storage Component in Lithium-ion Battery Technology” and shared methods for integrating the research energy of the Hi-GEM Research Center to develop  green applications in electronic service vehicles and energy storage systems and, in turn, facilitate development in the energy storage industry.

7,affordable-and-clean-energy,NCKU’s Commitment to Carbon Neutrality,"NCKU’s Commitment to Carbon Neutrality
The National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) acknowledges combating Climate Change has become a collective responsibility for everyone and will promote the importance of combating Climate Change and achieving carbon neutrality through education and multiple channels. It provides state-of-the-art knowledge at an academic level and plays an important role in contributing and enhancing knowledge about Climate Change on local, national, and international levels.
NCKU has committed to the following: 1. By 2024: Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to year 2010 levels. 2. By 2029: Reduce emissions to year 2000 levels. 3. By 2041: Achieve carbon neutrality with the interim goal of reducing NCKU’s carbon footprint by half by 2031, NCKU’s centennial.
NCKU has adopted policies to aggressively reduce greenhouse gases generated as a result of its activities. The NCKU Sustainable Practices Policy reflects and supports Taiwan environmental policy and law with regard to carbon reduction. NCKU has also committed to the ultimate goal of carbon neutrality, a commitment the University formally embraced along with colleges and universities worldwide, when it makes the United Nations SDGs its focus in all its research, teaching, and community outreach and adhere to the THE Impact Ranking criteria.
Climate neutrality means that NCKU will have zero net impact on the earth’s climate. This is achieved by minimizing GHG emissions as much as possible and procuring carbon attributes as necessary to mitigate the remaining emissions.
The Climate Solutions Committee was appointed to advise the President of NCKU on large-scale, systemwide strategies needed to fulfill these commitments. The committee was tasked with exploring planning and decision tools, financial and business models, emerging technologies, and large-scale renewable energy projects that have the potential to move the University’s carbon reduction commitments from concept to implementation.
NCKU’s Climate Goals
The Climate Solutions Committee has focused on the ultimate goal of climate neutrality in developing our recommendations. The rationale for this focus is threefold: It can and must be done. First and foremost is the conviction that climate neutrality can and must be achieved, although the technologies required to do so on the scale required are yet to be fully developed. Achieving the 2031 goal will facilitate climate neutrality soon thereafter.
Second, to achieve the 2031 goal, NCKU needs to develop a climate neutral energy supply on a massive scale.
Third, we recognize the serious reputational consequences of not achieving the goals set forth in NCKU’s climate commitments, including the ultimate goal of climate and carbon neutrality.
Emission Sources
Emissions are categorized as Scope 1 (direct), Scope 2 (indirect), or Scope 3 (other) based on their source. Each source carries with it specific issues and opportunities. Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions from sources controlled by campuses, primarily from combustion of natural gas in co-generation plants. NCKU does not have its own energy infrastructure but will be investing millions of dollars in a new energy infrastructure to generate renewable energy. Its operation will be essential to the University for the foreseeable future, and it is, in fact, a key to one of the recommended climate strategies.
Amongst the menu of possible technologies for generating renewable energy, solar, wind, and possibly co-generation (combined heat and power) plants are the most practical.  Co-generation plants are considered “green” because of the efficiency with which they convert natural gas into electricity and heat and are also carbon-efficient, emitting few units of CO2 per unit of energy produced. Yet they still will account for a certain percent of NCKU’s fixed carbon footprint because they burn natural gas, unless biomethane can substitute for natural gas.
Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions generated during production of electricity and steam that NCKU purchases. They account for a massive percent of NCKU’s emissions.  Unless they are renewable, NCKU’s Scope 2 emission will be substantial.  Taiwan’s government mandate requires utilities to provide 20% of their energy from renewable sources by 2025, which hopefully will reduce NCKU’s Scope 2 emissions. The extent to which Taiwan’s energy grid becomes renewable will determine NCKU’s Scope 2 emissions level.
Scope 3 emissions are other indirect emissions from sources not controlled by the University, primarily commuting and air travel emissions. The University’s Scope 3 emissions constitute a certain percent of the remaining carbon footprint and will also need to be negated to meet NCKU’s commitment to climate neutrality. Encouraging faulty and staff to reduce business travel and students to use bicycles and public transportation will reduce Scope 3 emissions.
Adaptation
Taiwan is located in a monsoon climate zone and stands in the path of typhoons, floods, and landslides. As the pattern of rainfall has become extreme, disasters have become more frequent and more damaging.  Adaptation has become an important issue.
Cross-disciplinary experts at NCKU incorporate SDG13 into their curricula and lead research intending to mitigate the impact of Climate Change.  NCKU also collaborate with domestic and foreign industries, government agencies, and research institutes.  NCKU and its partners connect with the government and the public through developing smart disaster prevention technology, holding academic seminars, handling local government and community education and training, and issuing research publications.

7,affordable-and-clean-energy,NCKU to Work Closely with E-One Moli Energy Corp. in the Development of Electric Car Power Systems,"Automobile industries worldwide are actively engaged in the development of electric cars. Taiwan is in urgent need of developing and acquiring relevant technologies to keep up with this trend. The battery module and power system are two critical aspects of electric car design. To support NCKU’s research on and integration of electric car technologies, E-One Moli Energy Corp., a leading lithium ion battery provider, recently donated 2000 high-power lithium ion batteries, which are equivalent to those employed in the Tesla Model 3, to be used for cross-disciplinary research and tests. In so doing, E-One expects to enter into industry–academia collaboration with NCKU, facilitating an upgrade to their technologies and accelerating the development of the domestic lithium ion battery industry.

NCKU and E-One held a press conference to announce their collaboration on 18, 2020. NCKU also took the opportunity to introduce the Intelligent Platform for Next-Generation Critical Vehicle Power Drive Module Design Integration, which is jointly directed by NCKU and China Steel and is a project under the second phase of the Great Industry–Academia Alliance Project. The platform is expected to play a crucial role in Taiwan’s development of essential electric car technologies. Additionally, NCKU briefly indicated their directions for future collaboration with relevant industries in the development of electric cars, an endeavor in which E-One is expected to play a substantial role.
In her speech at the press conference, President Dr. Huey-Jen Su expressed her gratitude toward E-One and indicated that NCKU has the cross-disciplinary research and integration capacity necessary for the development of electric car technologies. She further indicated her wish that the industry–academia collaboration would improve citizens’ quality of life, a long-held goal of NCKU for Taiwanese industry and society. The General Manager of E-One, Mr. Casey Shiue, followed by indicating that—in view of the gradual depletion of traditional fossil fuels, the pollution they cause, growing global awareness of environmental protection and renewable energy, and emerging interest in electric vehicles—he was pleased that E-One would have the opportunity to contribute to the development of relevant industries in Taiwan by offering its products for the research of NCKU.
The 2000 batteries from E-One, which are sufficient for one electric car, considerably lower the cost of the project. According to Professor Hsi-Sheng Teng of the Department of Chemical Engineering, because an electric car requires high-power battery modules, its chassis is almost entirely occupied by battery piles, which account for more than 30% of the cost of the entire vehicle. Presently, all major car manufacturers are busy developing their own battery power systems to gain an upper hand in the market. In terms of the integration of key technologies, the integration of battery modules with the power system is crucial to producing a vehicle with high endurance, accelerative power, and safety.
The Academia–Industry Technology Development Alliance Project (also known as the Great Industry–Academia Alliance Project), which is jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology and Ministry of Economic Affairs, has a mode of operation that can be summarized as follows: industry proposes a problem, and academia solves it. NCKU and China entered into collaboration in the first phase of the Great Industry–Academia Alliance Project, the Next-Generation Steel and Relevant Green Processing Methods and Innovative Product Application Industry–Academia Collaboration Project, from August 2013 to September 2018. The second phase, the Intelligent Platform for Next-Generation Critical Vehicle Power Drive Module Design Integration project, began in October 2018.
The general coordinator of the second phase of the Great Industry–Academia Alliance Project, Professor Mi-Ching Tsai of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, NCKU, indicated that the Intelligent Platform for Next-Generation Critical Vehicle Power Drive Module Design Integration project covers a wide range of disciplines and domains, including high-grade electrical steel, self-adhesive polymeric resin coating, high-performance traction motors, high-performance energy systems, intelligent transmission control, artificial intelligence, and cloud technology. The objective of the project is to establish Taiwan’s ability to design the power assembly of electric vehicles. In the Great Industry–Academia Alliance Project, the artificial intelligence computation and analysis capacity of the National Center for High-Performance Computing have also been employed in the optimization of battery performance monitoring and energy/power module integration.
E-One Moli Energy Corp. is an international enterprise specializing in the manufacturing and marketing of rechargeable lithium ion battery cells, and it has research and development and technical support centers in Taiwan and North America that support clients globally. Furthermore, it is the primary battery supplier of Dyson Ltd., a British technology company. E-One is highly experienced in the research and development of battery packs for electric cars and electric bicycles.

7,affordable-and-clean-energy,Offshore geotechnics and energy research team,"Taiwan's natural resources are limited and more than 99% of its energy supply is imported from other countries. In terms of either energy independence or diversity, Taiwan's energy security has a long way to go. Therefore, it is urgent for the government to develop independent energy and diversify energy sources. In line with the global trend in pursuing environmental protection and controlling greenhouse gas emissions, the 2005 National Energy Conference suggested that the government promote renewable energy power generation, and in 2011, new energy policies were announced to give considerable impetus to the ""thousand offshore/onshore wind turbines"" program. In 2016, the Ministry of Economic Affairs came up with a new energy-saving campaign to expedite local cooperation in promoting energy transformation. This plan pursues the nation’s goal of ""nuclear-free homeland"" by 2025 for an energy mix target of 50% gas-fired power generation, 30% coal-fired power and 20% renewable energy.
Wind power is one of the most mature renewable energy sources. There are considerable commercial wind farms around the world. The Taiwan Strait is rated by international firm 4C Offshore as having the best wind resources in the world, with an estimated installed area of 5,640km2 and a gross installed capacity of 29GW. Considering the small size and dense population of the nation, land-based wind energy development is gradually approaching a saturation point. In order to continue to advance the development of renewable energy industry, offshore wind power generation is a feasible direction. To ensure the safe operation of offshore wind power, marine engineering units need to build a safe and stable offshore wind power supporting structure and foundation, and provide the load combination of wind turbines resisting different environmental conditions during their service life. Europe has rich experience in offshore wind farm development, but faced with the harsh natural environmental conditions in Taiwan, it is difficult to directly transfer the existing experience and technology for our reference, and the current international design and certification consultants are unable to provide a complete reference solution. Taiwan should seize the opportunity of promoting offshore wind farm development to integrate the domestic academic-industry collaboration for a technical synergy. This collaboration can develop the offshore wind power infrastructure design and construction technology fit for Taiwan in view of frequent typhoons and earthquakes, so as to implement the development of localized offshore wind power industry.
A research team led by NCKU hydraulic and ocean engineering Associate Professor Yu-shu Kuo began in 2010 and has been engaged in offshore wind power and ocean energy research, promoting the offshore wind power foundation design, construction and maintenance industries’ establishment. Through the implementation of industry-academia programs, educational training, seminar exchanges, delegation exchanges and lectures, the research team has been working closely with the nation’s offshore wind power industry. Since 2014, Kuo's research team has been commissioned by domestic design consulting companies and industries to develop; (1) the analysis of cyclic axial loading behavior of the offshore wind turbine sleeve foundation, and (2) the design process of offshore wind turbine support structure with high liquefaction resistance potential in areas prone to strong earthquakes. The team has completed the stability evaluation of the large-caliber single-pile foundation and sleeve pile foundation in liquefied soil during earthquakes, and assisted the industry in the design and verification of the offshore wind turbine foundation. Since 2015, the team has been commissioned by the industry, government and academia to carry out offshore wind farm development and foundation design verification and maritime construction training. In 2017, it first proposed a quantitative risk assessment method for offshore wind farm foundation stability considering the given parameters of geotechnical design, the selection of earthquake duration and the uncertainty of terrain change caused by maritime construction. In 2018, the team carried out the energy integration project commissioned by the Ministry of Science and Technology to drill in the Changbin coastal area and evaluate the depth of hard rock face in order to assist the nation with the seismic evaluation of offshore wind farm design. The project also completed the nation’s first offshore wind turbine structure vibration monitoring and corrosion potential measurement, and assisted local developers to promote the establishment of offshore wind turbine operation and maintenance industries.
With the installation of three offshore meteorological observation towers and two pilot offshore wind turbines in Taiwan, offshore wind farms will be connected to the grid sequentially by the end of 2019. The results of offshore wind farm seismic force assessment and wind turbine foundation stability check will be tested by recording the offshore wind farm life cycle. Professor Yu-shu Kuo has devoted himself to the development of foundation design and maintenance technology of offshore wind turbines for a long time. He has provided students with sufficient learning resources for foundation design processes, numerical simulation skills, soil geological survey planning, risk assessment of marine geohazards, determination of geotechnical design parameters, and design verification processes. Through the professional courses and practical training provided by the laboratories at the university, the team is continuing to train high-level technical talent in connecting the offshore wind power and marine energy industries in alignment with the industry-university cooperation project.
台灣自然資源有限，超過99%之能源供給仰賴國外進口，不論以能源自主性、多元性考量，台灣之能源安全亟待提升，故發展自主能源、分散能源來源為政府施政刻不容緩之任務。配合全球追求環境保護、管制溫室氣體排放之趨勢，2005年全國能源會議建議政府推廣再生能源發電，2011年公布新能源政策，積極推動「千架海陸風力機」計畫，2016年經濟部提出新節電運動計劃，加速地方配合能源轉型推動工作，協助我國「非核家園」政策目標，於2025年達成燃氣發電50%、燃煤30%、再生能源20%之能源配比目標。
風力發電為目前發展最成熟的再生能源之一，全球已有為數可觀的商轉風力發電場。臺灣海峽被國際機構4C Offshore Offshore評定為全世界風力資源最佳區域，預估可安裝面積達5,640km2，總裝置容量達29GW。考量我國地狹人稠，近年來陸域風電開發場域已漸趨飽和，為持續推動再生能源產業發展，開發離岸風力發電為可行之方向。為確保離岸風電運轉安全，海事工程單位需建置安全且穩定之離岸風電支撐結構與基礎，提供風機於使用年限內抵抗不同環境條件之載重組合。歐洲離岸風場開發經驗豐富，但是面對台灣嚴苛的天然環境條件，既有的經驗與技術難以直接移植供我國參考使用，國際現行之設計驗證顧問亦無法提供參考完整解決方案。我國應藉由推動離岸風場開發的機會，整合國內產學研的技術能量，針對台灣特有強颱頻震環境開發適用於我國之離岸風電基礎設計與施工技術，落實本土化離岸風電產業發展。
成功大學水利及海洋工程學系郭玉樹教授帶領研究團隊自2010年起投入離岸風電與海洋能研究，推動離岸風電基礎設計、施工與運維產業建置，透過執行產學計畫執行、教育訓練、研討會交流、率團國際交流以及講演等方式，與國內離岸風電產業緊密結合。2014年起郭玉樹教授研究團隊接受國內設計顧問公司及產業委託，陸續開發(1) 離岸風機套管基礎受反覆軸向載重行為分析方法、(2) 強震區高液化潛勢離岸風機支撐結構設計流程，完成大口徑單樁基礎與套管樁基礎於受震液化土壤中之基礎穩定性評估，協助產業進行離岸風機基礎設計與驗證；2015起接受產官學界委託執行離岸風場開發與基礎設計驗證暨海事施工教育訓練；2017年首度提出考量地工設計參數給定、地震歷時選定及海事施工引致地形變動不確定性之離岸風機基礎穩定性風險量化評估方法；2018年透過執行科技部能源主軸整合計畫，於彰濱海域現地進行鑽探，評估堅硬岩盤面深度，以協助我國離岸風場設計地震力評估。該計畫亦完成我國首次離岸風機實機結構振動監測與腐蝕電位量測，協助本土開發商推動離岸風機運轉維護產業建置。
隨著我國完成3座離岸海氣象觀測塔及2支先導型離岸風機建置，離岸風場將於2019年底陸續併網發電，離岸風場地震力評估與風機基礎穩定性檢核成果將受到後續離岸風場生命週期的檢驗。郭玉樹教授長期致力於離岸風機基礎設計與維護技術開發，對於基礎設計流程、數值模擬技巧、土壤地質調查規劃、海域大地災害風險評估、地工設計參數決定方法、設計驗證流程等皆提供了學生充分的學習資源，透過在校實驗室提供之專業課程與實作訓練，配合產學合作計畫持續培養銜接離岸風電與海洋能產業之高級技術人才。

7,affordable-and-clean-energy,Guantian Black Gold: water chestnut shell charcoal biomass energy,"Currently, most of Taiwan's agricultural waste is disposed of by open burning, which causes air pollution and the increase of PM2.5 and carbon emissions that leads to strains in the relationship between environmental authorities and farmers. The future of agricultural waste prompts Professor Hung-ping Lin to pursue a circular economy and reduce energy waste from the perspective of recycling. The circular economy is different from the traditional industrial economic model of mining, manufacturing and discarding. Through redesigning products and business models, it can promote better resource utilization efficiency, eliminate waste and avoid polluting the natural environment.
Tainan’s Guantian is home to one of the largest water chestnut farm in Taiwan, with an annual output of nearly 3,700 tons. More than 90% of water chestnuts are abandoned for open burning or for incineration after collection by sanitation department. In order to solve this problem, Neng-tung Yen, executive of Guantian District, sought the feasibility of turning waste into energy for reuse and reached out to NCKU chemistry professor Hung-ping Lin. The research team scoured the market and the institutions involved for any technique. Although there are ways to make biochar, it requires the use of extra oil or electricity to produce it. Prof. Lin proposed an innovative way to turn water chestnut waste into biochar, which only requires heating during start-up. The team cooperated with the government to develop this technology, and the district office gathered non-governmental organizations to set up the ""Tainan Guantian Black Gold Community Cooperative"" to promote the merits of water chestnut shell charcoal. Under the official and non-governmental planning, the campaign was initiated by the government-academia-civil-industry cooperation for recycling and reusing agricultural waste.
The research team modified the conventional firing method, improved the furnace body, put the water chestnut shell into the furnace with temperature from 700 to 1000°C, controlled air flow, burned the remaining elements in the shell—which turns lignin into charcoal—and installed a detector for filtering at the furnace mouth to avoid secondary pollution. Fifteen to 17 kilograms of water chestnut shells can be transformed into 5 to 6 kilograms of water chestnut shell charcoal each time. After put into mass production, over 1,000 tons of the charcoal can be produced in one year. The charcoal burns itself in a high temperature and oxygen-free environment, resulting in very low carbon dioxide emissions, mitigating secondary pollution to the environment. The carbon fixation effect in the soil is excellent. The annual carbon reduction is equivalent to that absorbed annually by 1.1 Da'an Forest Parks. This innovative way resolves the problem of carbon emissions.
The team found that the charcoal can be sprayed in the field to preserve fertility, water and soil. Biochar itself is renewable energy and can be used as fuel to become green energy. In the process of producing water chestnut shell charcoal, a large amount of waste heat is generated, resulting in some energy emissions and losses. NCKU Prof. Wei-hsin Chen of aeronautics and astronautics and Prof. Hung-ping Lin jointly proposed the project of ""Development of Materials and Systems for Conversion of Thermal Energy Cycle Resources"" and received a subsidy for the second phase of the National Energy Program (NEP II) in 2018. The project aimed to recover the waste heat generated during chestnut coal burning, generate electricity from waste heat using thermoelectric chips, and complete the thermal energy cycle and power production. In addition, a wireless monitoring system was built to instantly understand the temperature change in the furnace and power generation data during the firing process to establish a complete example of an energy reuse system.
Prof. Hung-ping Lin’s research team has devoted many years to energy research. In addition to the above research, he has also worked on mesoporous nanomaterials and metal catalysts. Wastewater from industry contains significant amounts of heavy metals. The team converted this into nano-catalysts, turning pollution into resources, and applied it to catalyze the fuel-to-hydrogen system, providing new opportunities for energy research. This has not only turned pollution into a resource, but also converted fuel into energy, creating a win-win-win situation. At present, the team has also worked with Prof. Wei-Hsin Chen to actively propose a continuing industry-academia program to provide more energy-related research and innovation, hoping to make substantial contributions to energy issues.
目前台灣農業廢棄物，大部分都是以露天燃燒的方法來處理，造成空氣污染，PM2.5與碳排放量增加，也讓政府環保單位和農民的關係緊張。農業廢棄物的未來促使林弘萍教授從循環再利用的角度出發，達到循環經濟與降低能源浪費。循環經濟（Circular economy）有別於傳統經濟的開採、製造、丟棄的產業經濟模式，透過重新設計產品和商業模式，促進更好的資源使用效率、能消除廢棄物也避免污染自然環境。
台南官田是全國菱角最大的產地，每年生產近三千七百噸的菱角殼，90%以上菱角殼棄置露天燃燒或垃圾車清運焚化。官田區長顏能通為解決此問題，尋求廢棄物變為能源再利用可行性，找到成大化學系林弘萍教授。研究團隊搜尋坊間、市場上、以及相關單位，雖然有製作生物炭的方式，但需要額外使用油或電來燒製；林弘萍教授提出創新方式，僅啟動瞬間需要加熱，便可變成變成生物炭。團隊將此技術與官方合作，區公所集結民間力量成立「台南市官田烏金社區合作社」，推廣菱殼炭優點。在官方與民間的規劃下，囊括了「官、學、民、產」四個構面的發展，一同研發農業廢棄物循環再利用的契機。
研究團隊改良傳統燒製方式，改良爐體，將菱殼放入溫度控制在七百到一千度高溫的爐子，控制空氣流量，燒除菱殼內其餘元素，木質素則變成炭，爐口裝設偵側器以及濾淨功能，避免造成二次污染。每回可以將十五到十七公斤的菱殼，轉化產生五到六公斤的菱殼炭。量化後，一年可生產超過一千噸的菱殼炭。菱殼炭在高溫無氧的環境中自體燃燒，排出的二氧化碳非常少，降低對環境造成二度污染，使用在土壤中的固碳效果極佳，一年減碳量可達1.1座大安森林公園，此創新方式減少碳排的問題。
研究團隊發現菱炭可以撒在田間做保肥、保水、土壤改質之外，生物炭本身即是再生能源，可做為燃料使用，成為綠色能源；而在產生菱殼炭過程，所產生的大量廢熱，即是一種能源排放、損耗。航太系陳維新教授與林弘萍教授共同提出計畫，獲得107年度國家型能源型計畫第二期((NEP Ⅱ)經費補助，回收燃燒過程產生的廢熱，運用熱電晶片進行廢熱發電，完成熱能循環與電力生產。此外也同時建置無線監控系統，能在遠端即時了解燒製過程中，爐內溫度變化、發電量等數據，建立完整的能源再利用系統範例。
林弘萍教授研究團隊投入能源方面研究多年，除了以上研究，另也對於中孔洞奈米材料、金屬觸媒材料多有著墨；工業上所產生之廢水，含有大量重金屬，團隊將此轉換為奈米觸媒，污染變為資源，進一步應用於催化燃料轉換氫氣系統，對能源研究提供新的契機。此舉不僅將污染變成資源，同時產生燃料轉化為能源，創造三贏。目前也與陳維新教授積極提出延續性產學計畫，提供更多對能源相關研究與創新。希望以自身所學能對能源議題有更多研究與貢獻。

NCKU environmental engineering chair professor Wen-chih Lee’s team mixed 84-89% heavy oil, 10-14% oily industrial wastewater and 1% emulsifier proportionally and then fed them into the homogeneous emulsifying equipment with super-high revolutions. The continuous emulsifying equipment was used to develop heavy oil emulsifying technology to meet the feasibility of future industry application
In terms of energy efficiency testing, compared with 100% heavy oil used in seven chemical factories, it increased by 12.8-28.2%, with an average of approximately 18%. In addition, emulsified heavy fuel oil has made a significant contribution to pollutant emission reduction. Carbon dioxide emissions decreased by 14-28%, sulfur oxides by 15%, nitrogen oxides by 17%, granular pollutants by 36%, carbon monoxide by 84%, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by 37%, and carcinogenic equivalents by 47% after conversion. According to the data, emulsified heavy fuel oil can not only improve energy efficiency and make combustion more complete, but also contribute significantly to pollutant reduction. Taiwan's industry spends NT$300 billion a year on heavy oil. If all industries switch to emulsified heavy fuel oil developed by NCKU, there will be 10% profit after deducting equipment costs, emulsifiers and other costs, which will save at least NT$30 billion a year. Upon calculation by a chemical plant, it decided, when building its third boiler, to adopt the emulsified heavy fuel oil invented by the NCKU team, which required about NT$500,000 for related equipment. In the past, heavy oil used to cost NT$5 million per month, and the use of emulsified heavy fuel oil could save NT$500,000 per month and NT$6 million per year reflecting a 10% energy saving basis. In addition, emulsified heavy fuel oil solves the problems of oily industrial wastewater treatment and discharge. After preliminary separation of oil from water from oily industrial wastewater, the remaining oily water can be directly used to produce emulsified heavy fuel oil without discharging industrial wastewater, saving a treatment fee of NT$6,000 to NT$10,000 per metric ton. Moreover, based on the carbon tax (or carbon trading price) of NT$400-800 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions, approximately NT$16.7-33.4 billion is required payment for burning heavy oil in Taiwan in one year, and NT$2.3-4.7 billion for a minimum reduction of 14% if emulsified heavy oil is used. The emulsified heavy fuel oil from oily wastewater has been put into production. It achieves the reliable, sustainable and modern energy described in SDG7, and also solves the most important price issue of alternative fuels if used in large quantities. From the final calculation, affordable energy is just around the corner!
廢棄物轉能源為目前全球之趨勢，於工業界更是致力研究之方向，除降低處理廢棄物處理之費用外，亦可降低原料或燃料等成本；對地球而言更是降低環境污染等帶來之危害，亦舒緩化石能源危機之問題。成功大學環工系講座教授李文智研發團隊以84-89%重油、10-14%含油工業廢水、1%乳化劑比例均勻攪拌混合後送入具超高轉數之均質乳化設備，並利用連續式乳化設備進行重油乳化技術之研發，以符合將來實廠應用之可行性。
於能源效率測試方面，經7間實際化學工廠與過去使用百分之百重油相比，平均提升了12.8-28.2%，平均約18%。除此之外，於污染物排放減量方面，乳化重油亦有重大貢獻。二氧化碳排放減少約14-28%，硫氧化物減少約15%，氮氧化物減少約17%，粒狀污染物減少約36%，一氧化碳減少約84%，多環芳香烴減少約37%，經換算後減少致癌當量約47%。從數據來看，乳化重油不但能提升能源使用效率使燃燒進行更完全外，於污染物減量亦有重大貢獻。全台灣工業界一年花三千億元買重油，若全改用成大研發的乳化重油，扣除設備費用、乳化劑等成本，還有十％的利潤，一年至少省三百億元。經一實際化學工廠計算，於建造其第三座鍋爐時，決定採用成大團隊所發明之乳化重油做為燃料，所需相關設備約五十萬元，但業者過去每月重油耗費五百萬元，以節能十％計算，採用乳化重油後每月可省五十萬元，一年節省六百萬元。此外乳化重油也解決了含油工業廢水處理、排放等問題。工廠的含油工業廢水，經初步油水分離，剩餘含油的水可直接用於製造乳化重油，工業廢水不必排放，省下每噸六千至一萬元的處理費。另外，以每排放1公噸二氧化碳之碳稅(或碳交易價格)以新台幣400-800元計算，台灣地區燃燒重油一年約需繳交167-334億，如從上述之數據，如以最低14%減量計算，即可有約23-47億之規模。含油廢水乳化重油已付諸於實廠，不但符合SDG7所述之可靠的、永續的以及現代的能源，如能大量利用，更可以解決替代燃料截至目前為止最重要之價格問題，從最後之計算來看，負擔的起的能源，指日可待!

7,affordable-and-clean-energy,Global future trends: green energy storage industry,"Due to global warming, energy conservation and carbon reduction, along with the imminent depletion of oil, the world is at a critical stage of energy transformation. Across the world countries are vigorously promoting the green energy industry to help cope with the ensuing energy problems. With a consumer electronics boom, lithium-ion batteries have been widely used in many portable products, and now the electric vehicle industry has become part of the current development. The government has announced the goal of banning the sale of gasoline-powered motorcycles and fuel-powered cars for electric ones by 2035 and 2040, which is expected to improve air pollution and further drive the growth of demand for vehicle power batteries. Professor His-sheng Teng's research team has devoted many years to energy research; lithium batteries, super capacitors and photocatalytic water splitting, hoping to contribute more to the energy industry.
The four core materials of lithium-ion batteries are cathode material, anode material, electrolyte and isolation film. These affect the efficiency and endurance of batteries. The main function of the electrolyte is to provide current paths in the form of ions inside the batteries; it must have high ion transmission rates and not react with the electrodes. At present, the commercially available lithium-ion battery is based mainly on liquid electrolytes, but it is prone to leakage. This leads to corrosion, or melting of the separator due to high temperature factors, which will result in a short circuit and potential explosion of lithium-ion batteries. If a solid-state electrolyte based on a polymer or inorganic materials is used, it does not contain volatile and flammable organic solvents, nor does it need to use a separator, it can greatly improve the safety of the battery, and can be manufactured into any shape according to the appearance of the product. Our team, by keeping tabs on this key development trend, developed high potential and high safety solid electrolytes, and discussed in depth the interface characteristics between solid electrolytes and electrodes and the lithium-ion transfer mechanism. Furthermore, a collaboration with the lithium battery laboratory of the NCKU Fire Protection and Safety Research Center allowed us to test the production of soft pack batteries. In the future, it will become the core technology for manufacturers for energy transfer technology, and will drive independent technology development of lithium-ion battery industry to effectively save cost, manpower and time of developing lithium-ion battery materials.
In the development of electric vehicles, in addition to lithium batteries as the main energy supply, super capacitors have attracted increasing attention from the industry. A super capacitor (SC) is a high-capacity capacitor that can provide a physical secondary power supply with a strong pulse power. Its principle is to form a double charge layer by physical adsorption and desorption on the surface of electrodes through ions in the electrolyte. and then store the charge; hence they are also known as electric double‐layer capacitors. Super capacitors have the following advantages: high power density, excellent long-term performance, high-speed charging and discharging. However, because their storage mechanism does not involve chemical reactions, even if they have high power density, their energy density is lower than that of lithium batteries. Regarding its application in the electric vehicle industry, because of its high power density, it can be used to meet the requirement for instantaneous high current output of the motor when the electric vehicle starts, accelerates and brakes to recover kinetic energy. If super capacitors are used in conjunction with lithium batteries, the loss of battery life caused by high current discharge can be reduced and the battery life prolonged effectively. Super capacitors currently on the market are mostly based on liquid electrolytes. Given the leakage of liquid electrolytes, Professor His-sheng Teng's research team has been devoted to developing polymer gel solid electrolytes coupled with organic phase electrolytes to prevent leakage and enlarge the potential window of the super capacitor. The formula for calculating the energy density shows that enlarging the potential window can increase the energy density of super capacitors. In addition to polymer gel solid-state electrolytes, our team has been committed to the study of lithium-ion capacitors, which combines the strength of lithium-ion batteries (with a high energy density) and super capacitors (with a high power density), and created a new energy storage system with great potential for development.
In addition to lithium-ion batteries and super capacitors, solar energy is considered to be an ideal renewable and clean energy source. However, since the amount of sunlight reaching the planet varies depending on location, season and time, solar energy needs to be converted and stored in an economical and environmentally friendly way. A potential energy carrier, hydrogen has the advantage of high energy density, far exceeding the energy density of gasoline and coal. It has no carbon emission, but a useful by-product of water produced by combustion and is easy to transport. The research team used a rich material, graphene oxide quantum dots, to break water down into hydrogen and oxygen through sunlight. Various surface engineering strategies, such as surface morphology control, surface modification, surface junction and catalyst loading, have been developed by Professor Teng's team to produce more effective water decomposition. This technology customizes the properties of graphene oxide quantum dots and makes them more attractive for hydrogen generation.
由於全球暖化、節能減碳以及石油即將耗盡等議題，全球正處於能源轉型的關鍵時期，世界各國都正在極力推展綠能產業，以因應接踵而來的能源問題。隨著3C科技產業的蓬勃發展，鋰離子電池已大量運用在許多可攜式產品上，而電動車產業也成為當前世界發展的主流之一。政府宣示2035年新售機車全面電動化，2040年新售汽車面電動化的目標，期能改善空污問題，預計將進一步帶動車用動力電池之需求成長。鄧熙聖教授所帶領的研究團隊投入鋰電池、超級電容器以及光觸媒分解水等能研究方面研究多年，期望能對能源產業有更多貢獻。
組成鋰離子電池的四大核心材料為正極材料、負極材料、電解液及隔離膜，它們也影響了電池的效能和續航力，其中電解液的主要功能是在電池內部以離子的型態提供電流的通路，須具備高離子傳輸率及不易與電極發生反應等特性。目前市售鋰離子電池主要是採用液態電解質為主，但其易有洩漏導致腐蝕問題，或因高溫因素導致隔離膜融化，進而使鋰離子電池短路而爆炸；若使用以高分子材料或無機材料為主的固態電解質，因其不含揮發易燃的有機溶劑，也不需要使用隔離膜，不僅可以大幅提高電池的安全性，還可配合產品外觀需求任意設計形狀。本團隊掌握此關鍵發展趨勢，開發高電位與高安全性的固態電解質，並針對固態電解質與電極界面特性及鋰離子傳遞機制進行深入探討，並搭配成大防火研究中心鋰電池實驗室進行軟包全電池製作測試，未來將成為可供廠商技術移轉的核心技術，並帶動鋰離子電池產業自主技術開發動能，有效節省開發鋰離子電池材料的製程成本、人力與時間。
在電動車的發展中，除了鋰電池作為主要能源的供應外，超級電容器由於其本身持有的優勢，越來越受到業界的重視。超級電容器是一種具備高儲電能力，以及能提供強大脈衝功率的物理二次電源，其原理是透過電解質中的離子，在電極表面進行的物理性的吸附及脫附形成一雙電荷層，進而儲存電荷，因此又可稱為電雙層電容器。而超級電容器具有以下幾個優點：高功率密度、極佳長效表現、可高速充放電等優點，但由於其儲電機制沒有化學反應的參與，因此即使超級電容器擁有高功率密度，其能量密度相較於鋰電池較低。在電動車產業的運用上，由於超級電容器所具備的高功率密度，可運用在電動車在起步、加速、煞車回收動能時對於馬達瞬間大電流輸出的要求，若與鋰電池互相搭配使用，可以降低大電流放電對於電池壽命的損耗，有效延長電池壽命。目前市面上的超級電容器也以液態電解質為大宗，基於液態電解質之漏液等問題，鄧熙聖老師研究團隊致力開發高分子膠固態電解質，搭配有機相電解液，使超電容可供作之電位窗擴大，透過計算能量密度之公式可知擴大電位窗可提升超級電容的能量密度；除了高分子膠固態電解質，本團隊亦致力於研究鋰離子電容，其結合了鋰離子電池(高能量密度)以及超級電容器(高功率密度)的優點，是一種極具開發潛力的新型除能系統。
除了鋰離子電池以及超級電容器之外，太陽能被認為是一種理想的可再生且乾淨的能源。然而，由於到達行星的陽光程度的變化取決於位置，季節和時間需要太陽能以經濟有效且環境友好的方式轉換和儲存。氫是一種極具潛力的能量載體，具有高能量密度的優點，遠遠超過汽油和煤的能量密度，沒有碳排放，只有因燃燒產生的水的有用副產物，並且易於運輸。其研究團隊使用一種豐富的材料-氧化石墨烯量子點，並透過陽光將水分解為氫和氧。各種表面工程策略，例如表面形態控制，表面修飾，表面相結和助催化劑負載，以產生更有效的水分解已被鄧老師團隊所開發。此技術定制氧化石墨烯量子點的性質並使其對於氫氣量產生更具吸引力。

台灣積極發展再生能源，電力自由化現正起步，綠能科技更被列為前瞻基礎建設重點，政府在台南沙崙規劃設立綠能科學城，擘畫台灣創新綠能產業生態藍圖。已實施電力自由化的日本，除了減少電力浪費，有關電力消費的多元商業模式也應運而生。成功大學與國際知名的日本東京電力電網集團（TEPCO PG），6月15日簽署「跨國產學研發合作備忘錄」，將攜手設立研發中心，以台南沙崙為實驗場域，共同建構高附加價值的能源服務創新模式，研發更深更廣也更具前瞻性的低碳生活智慧能源解決方案。並將成立產學聯盟，邀請台灣相關業界加入，將台日能源產學創新研發成果輸向海外。
成大擁有九大學院，產學成效首屈一指，東京電力來台拓展海外事業，看中成大跨領域研發能力，雙方的合作也將是台灣能源策略轉型與台日能源產業跨國合作的重要橋樑！當天除簽署跨國產學合作備忘錄，也共同舉辦「新世代能源管理－智慧生態循環城市國際論壇」，呈現沙崙智慧生態循環城市的發展願景，勾勒台灣智慧都市發展樣貌。
成大校長蘇慧貞、東京電力常務取締役今井伸一，上午在零碳排放建築「成大綠色魔法學校」崇華廳代表雙方簽約。日本台灣交流協會高雄事務所所長中郡錦蔵、行政院政務委員吳政忠、國家實驗研究院院長王永和、東京電力取締役副社長岡本浩、台灣野村總研諮詢顧問總監小長井教授等均出席。簽約也促使40多位日本東京電力及能源相關企業高層與專家來成大參訪，是近年來日本電力相關產業最大規模與最高層級的訪問團，其中岡本浩是日本電網事業重量級人士之一，而台灣去年815停電事件，今井伸一是協助台灣電力規劃總檢的國際顧問之一。現場聚集超過80家公司主管與會，未來將與成大合作深化新一代能源策略及智慧能源應用的研發。
蘇慧貞指出，政府訂定2025非核家園，將台南沙崙「綠能科學城」視為台灣「創新綠能產業生態體系」的基礎藍圖，成大身為在地頂尖大學，也主動提出「沙崙智慧生態循環市」規劃，鏈結農場、科學園區及高鐵生活圈等多樣性環境任務，透過產官學的共同投入，開創新世代的生活模式、新的能源利用模式，構築出新型智慧都市典範。成大與東京電力集團締約之前，雙方已經多次深度溝通近8個月，東京電力對成大展現的格局、對未來新世代發展的企圖心以及技術能量都予以肯定，期待在不久的將來，能深耕能源技術和議題，共同發現能源加值服務的新利基。
今井伸一表示，台灣政府推動綠色能源發展、永續社會以及智慧城市，規劃沙崙綠能科學城，發展先進能源產製及應用，提供智慧綠色生活的體驗場域、建置再生能源應用的智慧電力調度及管理設計等，並向海內外招商，東京電力在輸配電系統、能源整合調度與運用管理上有很好的經驗，東電很榮幸受邀參與。東京電力積極拓展海外事業，將與成大建立緊密的夥伴關係，參與沙崙綠色科學城的開發計畫，包括建置區域能源管理系統，並就虛擬電廠、能源資訊運用等進行實證。另外，東京電力對於智慧城市、未來生活等面向也有一些新的想法，要透過在沙崙綠能科學城的計畫，在新場域與成大進行相關合作。
成大與東京電力簽署跨國產學研發合作備忘錄，雙方將從能源政策設計、系統架構和數據平台的管理，通訊技術發展、宅內IoT（物聯網）服務等議題發展合作可能性，展現能源加值服務新利基，再創電網及能源應用的智慧化未來，勾勒沙智慧生態循環城市的樣貌。
「新世代能源管理－智慧生態循環城市國際論壇」，邀請到早稻田大學、京都大學、成大、中央大學等能源領域學者及台日源產業領袖，從能源政策設計、管理系統架構、數據平台、通訊技術等面向展開對話，並呈現沙崙智慧生態循環城市發展願景。
論壇中，校長蘇慧貞分享成大主動規劃的「沙崙智慧循環生態城市」計畫案，要讓種甘蔗、鳳梨的農村，有新的再生循環經濟示範聚落。她表示，成大從「循環城市」、「智慧城市」、「永續城市」等三大主軸，設定一個2到3萬人的未來生活及工作場域的智慧循環新生城市，將交通系統、生活模式、傳統聚落、產業型態、氣候環境、智慧城市、循環經濟等議題一併整合，期許創建出一個台灣及國際資訊科技、醫療照護、交通運輸、教育休閒產業的新生活典範，從而啟動台灣新經濟模式，也讓雲嘉等其他區域城鎮得以複製並翻轉發展。
其他的演講包括，東京電力執行副總裁岡本浩，發表「Utility 3.0」專題演講，暢談日本智慧電網的演化歷程。早稻田大學石井英雄教授主講「日本能源政策暨制度設計」、成大楊宏澤教授「沙崙地區能源管理系統架構」、京都大學原田博司教授「通訊技術Wi-SUN在能源領域之應用」、東京電力事業開發室室長難波雅之「數據平台及擴展宅內IoT服務」等。主辦單位並安排兩個場次綜合座談，由國實院王永和院長、中央大學林法正教授與台日雙方重量級能源領域學者共同參與討論。
成大資訊工程系教授莊坤達指出，日本近年來電力自由化，在能源供應、輸配電（電力網）以及售電端的能源市場已全面競爭，再生能源佔比不斷上升，能源利用率也提高。東京電力從傳統獨佔電力業者，面對新趨勢的挑戰，依然保有高度競爭力，其一路走來的經驗，尤其是「智慧電網」的發展，將是台灣電力自由化過程重要的參考與借鏡。
台灣過去對能源議題著重在創能（能源供應）與儲能，然而，利用資通訊科技，收集與偵測電力供應與使用，調整電力生產與耗電以達到節能、降低耗損的「智慧電網」已是發展智慧城市不可缺的一部份。目前台灣發展智慧電網才起步，在澎湖東吉嶼第一個無人化管理的微電網，澎湖七美島也正在建置，台北市也將在興隆公共住宅試辦「智慧電網第零期計畫」。
莊坤達說，日本電力自由化，電力公司為了爭取商機，早已推出多樣化的電費方案，猶如台灣的手機優惠方案，現在日本的電力業者更進一步思考與研究，如何將「智慧電網」的資料數據應用在生活面向上，例如日本社會高齡化，社區獨居老人多，透過居家電力使用量的多寡或效率，可成為判斷長輩生活作息是否如常的依據。或是分析賣場能源使用數據，以查知不同部門的用電量效率，來得知冷凍櫃是否故障等維護問題。
東京電力，成立於1951年，旗下的發電廠以火力發電為主，水力與再生能源為輔，也有兩間核能電廠。曾是日本營收最高的電力公司，近年來積極海外投資能源相關項目，在東南亞、歐洲、美國、澳洲、巴西等有投資。

8,decent-work-and-economic-growth,NCKU Alumnus Albert Liu Becomes the Pride of Taiwan in the Field of Artificial Intelligence,"Albert Liu, a graduate of the Department of Electrical Engineering, NCKU, founded his company Kneron in the United States in 2015. Within 2 years of founding the company, Liu won tens of millions US dollars’ worth of financing from numerous investors such as the Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund. Moreover, Liu participated in the 2019 Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the United States and excelled in the lightweight face recognition algorithm section. These spectacular feats have made him the pride of Taiwan in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), but he remains pragmatic as a true NCKU alumnus. “Nobody knows what will happen in the future; all that you can do is make the most of every day,” says Liu.
Kneron, a startup that has made it big in only a few years
Liu graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering in 2003. Subsequently, he received his PhD in Electrical Engineering from UCLA and went on to found Kneron in San Diego, California, after working in the United States for several years. The company became successful and a leader in edge AI solutions in only a few years. It won the financial support of numerous venture capital funds in 2017, notably the Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund, Sequoia Capital, Qualcomm, Himax, and China Development Financial. In April 2018, it received 180 billion US dollars’ worth of investment from Horizons Ventures, the final investment project of Sir Li Ka-shing before his retirement. Overall, it has attracted 330 billion US dollars’ worth of capital. Kneron’s face recognition software has entered the market and is selling well. Liu’s success raises the question of why he felt the need to participate in the FRVT.

“Many world-class AI companies participate in NIST competitions, and I knew that our face recognition software was very competitive. More importantly, I wanted to learn Kneron’s place in the international market. In the end, Kneron outperformed many tough competitors in the lightweight division, which was quite unexpected.” The outcome was a heartening surprise for Liu.
His seemingly trouble-free road to entrepreneurship was in fact filled with frustrations and setbacks. For example, one client deliberately picked on the company on numerous occasions because the company did not know the importance of giving a client’s representatives a treat, which is an unspoken rule in the industry. Another example is that when a manager went on a business trip, all of the manager’s subordinates suddenly resigned. Thinking back on why he started his business, Liu confided without hesitation that he had intended only to help put together a team for a friend who wanted to start a business. However, his friend failed to attract any investment, which was a problem for numerous members of the recruited team who had quit a good job in Taiwan and travelled to the United States. To take up the responsibility and because he sensed an opportunity, Liu quit his job and threw his lot in with the team. “There is no telling what will happen in the future. You can only listen to the voice in your heart. Starting a business was a decision made on a whim.”
“There is no telling what will happen in the future. You can only listen to the voice in your heart.”
Startups are becoming a worldwide trend, and Liu advised ambitious NCKU students to “follow your heart and do not put a limit on yourself. Never allow yourself to be shackled by limitations, and never underestimate yourself. Keep fighting and exploring even in adversity, and you will eventually prevail.”
Liu cautioned that although NCKU graduates are favored in industry, if a person aspires to achieve great things and have the power to attract and influence people, they must always be sincere and have passion. Partners in entrepreneurship are often close friends made during various stages of life. Honesty, pragmatism, guilelessness, frankness, modesty, sincerity, kindness, and tolerance are all qualities that enable an entrepreneur to gather old friends around them and work together for a common goal.
Liu believes that his four years in NCKU played no small part in helping him endure the trials in the early stage of his business. “The four years were very special. In the whole history of Taiwan, we were the only class that had neither a school opening ceremony [cancelled because of the great earthquake of September 21, 1999] nor a graduation ceremony [cancelled because of the SARS outbreak].”
The colorful four years in NCKU prepared Liu for the challenges in later life
Liu remembers how everyone leapt out of bed and rushed outside in wild panic on the day of the great earthquake. Two years later, the September 11 attacks brought another shock. “It was as if the whole world was on the brink of war.” Upon his graduation, the SARS outbreak occurred. “We felt that something as trivial as having a meal in a restaurant was taking a great risk, because we could suddenly be infected by an unknown virus.” Additionally, the NCKU MP3 incident occurred in his senior year, in which prosecutors seized the computers of numerous NCKU students. “I wrote an article titled ‘What was the crime of the students?’ online and mobilized many people to participate in a several-day sit-in protest on University Road. We won widespread support and compelled the then Ministry of Justice, Ma Ying-jeou, to pay us a visit. In the end, the students got their computers back without further trouble.”
“These extraordinary experiences prepared me for all the challenges I encountered in my studies overseas and in later life,” Liu says with a smile. It appears that Liu can always tell an anecdote or two regarding his colorful university life. Not long after becoming a freshman, he was appointed the general event coordinator of his class and was thus responsible for planning joint activities with other departments. He soon organized a winter expedition to eastern Taiwan together with students from the Department of Nursing. He also established a team that achieved first place in the Freshmen Cup and established and coached the department’s first girls' volleyball team. His other exploits included winning prizes in the university’s karaoke and music competitions, visiting all the well-known tourist spots in central and southern Taiwan with a few friends, and serving as administrator of his class’s BBS board. He admits that he did not always adhere to what was taught in class or textbooks, sometimes skipped classes, and often prepared for an exam at the very last minute. However, in his sophomore year he took some courses offered by other colleges of the university, notably the College of Management, out of his interest in learning and exploring new things. Overall, he was a somewhat atypical student.
Liu has vivid memories of his university days. The freedom to take various courses and the abundance of after-school activities offered him ample opportunities for exploring different domains, and these experiences became resources in later life. Moreover, he made many life-long friends at the university.
Kneron is a startup company that provides edge computing solutions featuring the company’s unique Reconfigurable Artificial Neural Network technology, which improves computation efficiency and thus helps clients lower their costs. Unlike conventional cloud-based solutions, edge computing solutions allocate a portion of computing tasks from the cloud to a terminal device for real-time audio and visual recognition. This approach enables offline recognition, which is stable and offers favorable privacy protection. It can be applied to smartphones, smart homes, and smart security systems.

8,decent-work-and-economic-growth,Taiwan NCKU Top 2 university in Asia in THE University Impact Ranking,"The Times Higher Education (THE) magazine on Thursday (April 22) released the Impact Rankings 2020, and two Taiwanese universities were on the list, with National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) at 38th in the world and 2nd in Asia, a new record high for Taiwanese schools in the world's four major ranking agencies.

NCKU President Dr. Huey-Jen Su (蘇慧貞) mentioned that the school was one of the first universities in the country to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Su linked the extraordinary achievement to the school's wide range of applications, from internal affairs in campus, to participating in international medical and humanity rescue services.
The Impact Rankings were evaluated based on each university’s ability to support and deliver on the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals. NCKU stood out in the categories of SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG9 (Industry Innovations and Infrastructure), and SDG14 (Life Below Water) across the higher education sector — of which it ranked among the top 20 in the world.

8,decent-work-and-economic-growth,NCKU’s SATU Event Gathers 72 Universities in Southeast and South Asia to Discuss Higher Education Talent and Academia-Industry Innovation,"NCKU hosted the 2018 Presidents' Forum of Southeast and South Asia and Taiwan Universities (SATU Presidents' Forum). The opening ceremony was held in Ge-Chi Hall on the morning of the 16th and was attended by 72 presidents and representatives from universities in Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, and Brunei to discuss academia-industry development involving agriculture, healthcare, and engineering. The biennial transnational event attracting considerable attention, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Mei-Hua Wang and Political Deputy Minister of Education Leeh-Ter Yao were both present to express their support for the SATU platform and their hope to continue talent exchanges between Taiwan and other countries in Southeast and South Asia.
Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Mei-Hua Wang placed particular emphasis on the importance of talent exchange, indicating that it not only brings short-term benefits but also exerts long-term influences on Taiwan, especially with the New Southbound Policy. She also shared with the attendees Taiwan’s experiences in cultivating science and technology talent to promote industrial development, stressed the need to cultivate more computer and AI talent in Taiwan to cope with the future digital era, and looks forward to collaborations between Taiwan and other SATU members.
Political Deputy Minister of Education Leeh-Ter Yao recognized SATU as a fine exchange platform and a solid foundation for collaborations between countries. He pointed out that Taiwan is currently proactively promoting a university social responsibility (USR), and through the SATU platform, it is hoped that international USR can be developed in the future to propel regional prosperity and progress.
Due to the fact that NCKU is the permanent international secretariat of SATU, NCKU President Dr. Huey-Jen Jenny Su felt that their responsibility was even greater. “One of the crucial tasks of SATU is to cultivate top local talent so as to effectively resolve many international problems and challenges,” she indicated. NCKU initiated the SATU Presidents' Forum in 2003, and it is the first international alliance in academia-industry cooperation to be promoted in Taiwan. Prior to the New Southbound Policy, SATU had already become a crucial channel of practical exchange among institutions of higher learning in Taiwan, India, and other nations in Southeast Asia. SATU has also brought about significant achievements with 34 collaboration projects among member universities and much international support.
Six new universities joined SATU in 2018, the scope of its membership reaching a record high. The number of attending foreign presidents this year was also the highest in the last three forums. The total number of attendees increased by 25%, including attendees in positions higher than vice president or vice president for international affairs in top universities in Taiwan, India, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines. It is the also the first time that four representatives from the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) attended the forum. CEO of the Research and Services Headquarters Chih-Han Chang, who is responsible for academia-industry cooperation at NCKU shared NCKU’s academia-industry experiences in the first speech of the forum, which focused on the challenges that higher education institutions face regarding industry chains.
Chih-Han Chang mentioned that NCKU has so far established 3 overseas R&D bases in accordance with the New Southbound Policy with the objective of sustainability and that new bases are also being planned in Indonesia and the Philippines. He stated that academia-industry cooperation is already a crucial matter around the world but also faces many new challenges. He first gave a brief introduction to the basis and energy of academia-industry cooperation in NCKU, named some successful cases, and explained how failed cases could be improved. He further analyzed what NCKU learned in regards to intellectual property patents. “For a university that can implement patents on its own, any unlicensed patent will become a liability, not an asset.” For universities, maximizing the value of intellectual property patents means find ways to license them. He emphasized, “A good patent portfolio determines whether a technology has value.”
Chih-Han Chang also shared some achievements in innovation and entrepreneurship. In recent years, NCKU has made many adjustments and achieved much progress. From the perspective of the university, “technology is important; commercial models are more important, and even more important are teams.” Most universities only have technical teams; Chih-Han Chang maintained that even with first-class technology, teams without administration, finance, and regulations only have a small chance of success. For this reason, NCKU has been actively investing in innovation and entrepreneurship in the past few years and assembling diverse talent to create good commercial models.
Finally, with the Global Research & Industry Alliance (GLORIA) platform that NCKU established the year before as an example, Chih-Han Chang explained how the model uses an industry membership scheme to make technological R&D at NCKU more efficient and its industry chain relations closer. As a result, industries will be able to perceive the superb technologies, talent, and service from NCKU. “The managers at GLORIA understand the differences between academic and industrial jargon, so they can help transfer technologies into production processes and increase success rates.”
As the permanent international secretariat of the SATU Presidents' Forum, NCKU is a constant international culture and education organization between universities in Taiwan and in Southeast and South Asia. With the promotion of collaborative exchanges and progress in higher education as its purpose, the biennial SATU Presidents' Forum also aims to achieve six objectives: strengthen academic cooperation among Taiwan and Southeast and South Asian countries, foster internationalization through academic and cultural exchange and collaboration, promote the quality of education, research, and community services, establish exchange programs for university students, faculty, and administrative staff, foster partnerships between industry and academia, and facilitate sustainability in economics, society, and the environment.
成功大學主辦2018臺灣與東南亞暨南亞大學校長論壇（SATU），16日上午在格致堂開幕，包括台灣、印度、印尼、馬來西亞、越南、泰國、新加坡與菲律賓、汶萊等地區72位校長或代表齊聚，討論農業、醫療、工程方面的產學發展。兩年一次的跨國盛會備受矚目，經濟部次長王美花、教育部政務次長姚立德都到場對SATU平台表示肯定，也期待繼續推動臺灣與東南亞、南亞之間的人才交流。
經濟部次長王美花特別強調人才交流的重要性，不只能帶來短期的效益，也會為國家帶來長久的影響，尤其在新南向的推動上扮演重要角色。她也向各國校長分享台灣培育理工人才促進產業發展的經驗，認為未來因應數位時代，台灣需要培育更強大的電腦及AI人才，期待與SATU各國成為合作的好夥伴。
教育部政務次長姚立德肯定SATU是很好的交流平台，建立一個國與國之間合作很堅固的基石，指出台灣目前積極推動大學社會責任（USR）計畫，透過SATU平台，也期待未來可以發展國際性的USR，帶動所在地區的繁榮與發展。
成大身為SATU永久國際秘書處，成大校長蘇慧貞更覺責任重大，「SATU的重要任務之一就在培養在地頂尖人才，有效解決國際間許多問題和挑戰。」她指出，成大自2003年起持續推動SATU台灣與東南亞暨南亞大學校長論壇，是台灣推展產學合作上的第一個國際性聯盟，在新南向政策前，SATU就已經是台灣高等學府和東南亞、印度國家之間建立實際交流的重要管道，也帶來顯著成果，會員國之間有34個合作計畫，也獲得其他更多的國際支持。
2018年SATU，新增6個會員學校，規模更創歷年最高，外國校長參與人數達前三屆之最，總參與人數成長25％，包括臺灣、印度、馬來西亞、越南、泰國、新加坡與菲律賓的頂尖大學都由國際長及副校長層級以上代表與會，且首次有印度理工大學（IIT）4位分校代表參與。首場演講邀請成大專責產學合作的研究總中心主任張志涵，以「高等教育機構在產業鏈結方面出現的挑戰」為題分享成大產學經驗。
張志涵指出，成大至今已設置3個新南向海外研發基地，以永續發展為目標，未來也鎖定在菲律賓、印尼等地繼續籌備基地。他認為，產學合作在世界各國已經是很重要的事情，也面臨許多新的挑戰。他首先簡介成大產學的基礎和能量，分享成功經驗，也分享失敗的經驗如何改善，並且進一步分析成大在智財專利上學到的事，「對一個自己會實施專利的學校而言，所有沒有授權的專利，會成為負債而不是資產。」對大學來說，如何讓智財專利發揮應該有的價值，就是要想辦法授權出去，強調「好的專利佈局會決定技術有沒有價值」。
張志涵也分享創新創業成果，成大近年來有許多調整和成長，從學校角度來看，「技術很重要，商業模式更重要，而更重要的是團隊」。大部份學校只有技術團隊，但張志涵認為，即使技術一流，卻缺少業務、財務、法規等團隊，要成功的機會其實不大，因此 成大近年來積極投入創新創業，整合多元化人才，創造好的商業模式。
最後，張志涵以去年成立的成大國際產學聯盟平台為例，說明該模式是利用產業會員機制，讓成大的技術研發和產業鏈結的關係更有效率且更為緊密，讓產業感覺到成大好的技術、好的人才，讓產業有感，覺得服務到位。「國際產學聯盟經理人理解學術語言和產業語言的差異，進而能夠幫助技術轉譯到產品的過程，成功率提高。」
成功大學2017年分別於馬來西亞的馬來亞大學及越南的胡志明醫藥大學建立海外共同研究中心，任務包含舉辦醫材教育訓練、雙邊共同研討會、辦理產業論壇、連結當地學科展會等活動，今年11月初，成大與泰國馬希竇大學也成立了共同研究中心，成為成大第3個海外研發基地，未來更朝向與其他東南亞國家一流醫學大學建立更深度的合作關係，期盼透過學術發展促進國際人才及產業需求整合，提升區域成長並創造共同價值。
SATU校長論壇由成大擔任永久國際秘書處，為臺灣與東南亞暨南亞各大學間之常態性國際文教組織，透過每兩年舉行一次的校長會議，以推動及促進彼此高等教育之合作交流與發展為宗旨，同時達成包含「加強東南亞國家與臺灣之學術合作」、「經由學術與文化之交流合作促進國際化」、「提昇教育及研究與社區服務之質與量」、「建立學生及教師與行政人員之交流計畫」、「促進產學合作與致力於經濟」及「社會與環境之永續發展」等六大目標。

8,decent-work-and-economic-growth,"Revolutionizing Orthodix Teaching and Returning Universities to Their Roots FREE Lunch, FREE Talks for Our Future","At C-HUB from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM every Tuesday from October to the end of December this year, the College of Planning and Design at NCKU has been holding a series of cross-disciplinary forums called CPD Talks: Synergy for the Future. The subjects of these talks focus on four issues, namely, technology, sustainability, education, and innovation, and the talks are being jointly planned and executed by the Department of Industrial Design, the Department of Architecture, the Department of Urban Planning, and the Institute of Creative Industries Design. The primary organizer behind the talks, Dean Tay-Sheng Jeng of the College of Planning and Design, is fulfilling a wish that he has had for 18 years: to introduce the culture of cross-disciplinary exchange from overseas to the College of Planning and Design at NCKU, offer the latest knowledge and technology that cannot be learned in the classroom, eradicate old practices, and return universities to their roots. NCKU president Jenny Huey-Jen Jenny Su, who wholeheartedly supports this project, stated that they will promote the spirit and methods to other colleges in NCKU so that teachers and students will be able to engage in cross-disciplinary learning in an atmosphere of unlimited exchange.
The name of the talks conveys the hope that participants will be able to vocalize innovative ideas that will benefit the future through discussion and argument. Dean Tay-Sheng Jeng indicated that a college is the window between university and departments as well as the link between departments and stressed that its responsibility is to gather cross-disciplinary impacts. The College of Planning and Design comprises three departments and one institute, which began to unify with CPD Talks. They have surpassed their independent operations in the past and co-created a platform for sharing.
CPD Talks began in October with Vice Dean Min-Yuan Ma of the College of Planning and Design, sharing his experiences with Stanford d-school. In November, Dean Lin-Lin Chen from Eindhoven University in the Netherlands and three foreign students from NCKU’s Department of Architecture were invited to host cross-disciplinary exchanges. Each talk offered free lunch, and Dean Tay-Sheng Jeng stressed with joy that they have been providing an average of 100 free lunches to attending teachers and students every week, so attendance has been good.
Assistant professor Ing-Tse Chen has attended three weeks in a row and greatly approves of the talks. “It’s great to be able to have such an exchange platform. The few times I attended all felt pretty good. With the CPD Talks, teachers have regular opportunities to meet and learn together in their busy schedules, and it also deals with their need to eat on campus.” Ing-Tse Chen said that during the talks, she learned about the off-campus implementation strategies of the USR project, the blueprint plans for the Shalun Smart Green Energy Science City in Tainan, and the achievements and prospects of the Ministry of Science and Technology’s Cross-Field Value-Adding program. She also had the opportunity to meet teachers from other departments and build connections during lunch, so each talk has been a major gain for her.
Students have also been actively participating in the talks. Gao-hua Liu, a student at the Department of Industrial Design who has attended every week, said that the experiences shared by Professor Ma on d-school left a deep impression on him and that participating in the talks has given him an understanding of projects in similar fields. Department of Industrial Design Nei-Wen Chang said, “I will continue to recommend it to my friends because of the free lunch.” Department of Urban Planning student Hsuan-Ho Yu noted, “It takes place during lunch time, so other things are less likely to get in the way.” Students are free to gather at C-HUB and have the opportunity to listen to the experiences shared by talkers, gain new knowledge, or interact with one another.
While free lunch may seem like the main attraction of the talks, it also played a role in the origin of the talks. Dean Tay-Sheng Jeng recalls the impact of the first Brown Bag Lecture that he attended while studying at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US in 1996 and still vividly remembers listening to the lecture with a brown bag lunch in his hands. Each week, the lecture venue offered a spectacular Buffet. Everyone was free to come and go, and it was completely free. “Enjoying a feast while learning about future technology was a major shock for a student studying abroad and makes you realize that there really is such a thing as free lunch!”
Tay-Sheng Jeng emphasized, “In the era of innovation, I hope to introduce the culture of cross-disciplinary exchange from overseas to the College of Planning and Design at NCKU, offer the latest knowledge and technology that cannot be learned in the classroom, eradicate old practices, and return universities to their roots.” Universities should be a place of knowledge integration, sharing, and exchange and where different opinions are aired. In this way, students and teachers can use their differences to train their critical thinking. However, most projects in the academia operate top-down with tasks being assigned, which leaves little room for independent thinking and new opportunities. Contrary to the standard, the CPD Talks held by the College of Planning and Design goes bottom-up and breaks with conventions. Teachers from various departments have free rein. They can seek topics they are interested in and autonomously create a platform that facilitates exchange, cooperation, and even fusion.
As for the actual achievements of the talks, Dean Tay-Sheng Jeng is keeping an open mind. He also plans to organize Pecha Kucha events and even national policy debate competitions. He stated, “Our most important objective is to make the participants really feel that education and learning are Free. We want them to form deep impressions during the talks. Maybe even something they inadvertently hear could change the way they think.”
成大規劃與設計學院 2018 年 10 月起至 12 月底，每週二中午12點到下午 1 點在 C-HUB 成大創意基地舉辦跨領域系列論壇 CPD Talks：Synergy for the Future，論壇主題囊括科技、永續、教育、創新等4個焦點議題，並集結工設系、建築系、都計系及創產所共同策劃及執行。主要發起人規劃與設計學院鄭泰昇院長表示自己一償任教以來 18 年的夙願，「將國外跨域交流的文化引進成大規設學院，並提供課堂上看不到、最先進的知識技術，改變舊有的風氣，回歸大學的本質。」大力支持此計劃的蘇慧貞校長則表示，將把此一精神及作法推廣到成大其他院系，在不設限的交流氛圍中促成師生跨域學習。
CPD 為 College of Planning & Design 的縮寫，而 Synergy for the Future 則為未來的協同效應。意指參與者將藉由一次次不同的論點撞擊，反映出對未來世界有所助益之創新思維。鄭泰昇院長指出，一所學院作為介於校與系之間的對口，以及系與系之間的連結，其責任應是匯聚跨領域的碰撞。而規劃與設計學院的三系一所，將開始藉著 CPD Talks 而凝聚一堂，跨越以往各自的獨立經營，共創分享的平台。
CPD Talks 10 月率先由規設學院馬敏元副院長以《Stanford d-school 經驗分享》揭開序幕，11 月先後邀請荷蘭 Eindhoven University 陳玲鈴院長、成大建築系 3 位外籍生等人進行跨域交流。每次論壇皆提供免費午餐，鄭泰昇院長開心地強調，截至目前，平均每週提供 100 份免費午餐給自由參加的師生。可見此計劃吸引不少師生參與。
成大建築系助理教授陳穎澤至今就連續參與 3 週，對此活動深表肯定。「能夠有這樣交流的平台很好。幾次參加下來感受都相當不錯，老師之間因為有 CPD Talks 而能在忙碌的工作中固定聚集、一起學習，同時解決校園裡用餐的需求。」陳穎澤說，在與談者的分享中不僅了解到 USR 計劃走出校園的實踐策略、台南沙崙智慧綠能科學城的規劃藍圖，以及科技部多年來在跨域加值計畫之努力成果與願景，還有機會跨界認識別系的老師，善用午餐時間創造連結，讓她每一場都覺得大有收穫。
學生參與的情況也相當踴躍，每週都出席的工設系劉高華同學說，第一場馬老師分享關於 d-school 的內容令他印象深刻，參與該活動讓他了解相似領域的專案內容。工設系張乃文同學則表示，「因為有 free lunch，所以會持續推薦朋友來參加。」而都計系余宣和同學認為，「活動時間在中午，較不容易卡到其他事。」同學們自由聚集在C-HUB聆聽與談者分享、汲取新知，抑或是彼此互動，都是相當寶貴的機會。
免費午餐似乎是活動吸引人的一點，而這更是活動緣起的亮點。鄭泰昇院長回憶，1996年他在美國喬治亞理工學院求學時，第一次參加 Brown Bag Lectures 活動的震撼，拿著牛皮紙袋中餐聽演講的情景仍歷歷在目。每週在演講現場還有滿桌豐盛的 Buffet 可自行取用，且自由入場、完全免費，「一面享受宴席一面接觸未來科技的畫面，對當時旅外留學的學生來說，不僅是莫大的衝擊，更體悟原來天底下真的有白吃的午餐！」
鄭泰昇描述，負責籌辦那場演講的 GVU Center 邀請到 MIT 麻省理工學院的學者來分享，一位穿戴各種電子裝置的「機器人」走進會場，現場投影出該「機器」人眼睛所觀看之畫面，就如同現在的VR原型。想當年尚未有穿戴式電腦的概念，卻已有如此前衛的技術應用，令人驚奇。
更讓人印象深刻的是，設計心理學權威 Donald Norman 教授一進場，舉起一張紙和一部筆記型電腦，詢問在場聽眾何者才是最高深的科技？想必許多人都會回答是筆電，但講者卻說：「是紙！」紙才是最偉大的資訊科技，因為紙不但是文字介面，也是文化載體，有很好的使用介面，可以彎、可以折，眼淚滴在信紙上，還可以留下「情感」的痕跡；但電腦不行，檔案一刪掉便消失了。
鄭泰昇說，這一幕著實讓他開了眼界，也令他再次反思面對科技的態度。比方近期被高度討論的 AI 人工智慧、深度學習，各界均預測將取代醫師、律師等專業，但他認為，大學教授不應該一昧地遵循主流的立場及風向，若嘗試運用批判性思考，是否能提出不同的看法進行一場論辯賽？
鄭泰昇強調，「在創新的年代，我們難道還在用上一代傳統的方法去教導我們的下一代？希望能將國外跨域交流的文化引進成大規設學院，並提供課堂上看不到、最先進的知識技術，改變舊有的風氣，回歸大學的本質。」大學本應是一處充滿知識整合、分享交流、激盪出不同觀點的場所，藉此，師生可在彼此差異間訓練批判性思考。然而，學界許多計劃案的運作程序通常是自上而下、命令式的指派任務，難以有自主思考與創新的機會。因此，有別於制式的流程，規設學院籌辦 CPD TALKS 時反而是以由下而上的方式進行，突破傳統模式，讓各系老師自由發揮，尋找有興趣的主題參與，自主地建立易於交流、合作、甚至產生融合的平台。
「當初聽到他們提出的方案，其實我也不知道會發生什麼事？」但不設限能達到什麼預設效果，就是鄭泰昇院長籌辦本次活動的原則。例如 10 月 9 日由奇美醫院老人科主任蔡岡廷針對《在宅醫療趨勢下的設計需求》提出高齡化社會及醫療需求的轉變，看起來跟規劃設計並不相關，但事實上，不論在醫療產品、空間規劃、都市社區營造等，這個議題均具備相當密切的關聯。10 月 16 日及23 日分別由張秀慈教授、林子平教授、陳世明教授闡述 USR 計劃的意義、策略、各場域實踐的成果展示。
對於活動的實際成果，鄭泰昇院長保持開放態度，未來也計劃安排一場 Pecha Kucha 跨域交流、甚至國家政策辯論賽。他表示，「我們最重要的目標是，讓參與者實際感受到教育與學習是 Free的，且得以在參與過程中，留下深刻的印象，也許是不經意地聽到一句話，進而讓舊有的思維轉變。」他深信，師生們在吃東西時較容易放鬆、較不受拘束，有助於打開心胸接收新知，老師們藉由定期聚集，在中午用餐時間閒聊，當人人都開始走出自己的領域，了解其他領域在做的事，便能創造出更多交流的機會。這也就是 CPD TALKS 的兩大重要特色。（撰文、攝影／實習記者黃千容　圖片／成大規劃與設計學院提供）

8,decent-work-and-economic-growth,Achieving sustainable development is fundamentally anchored to what makes governance inclusive across levels,"Dr. Weena Gera receives the 2018 Gro Brundtland Award during the Week of Women in Sustainable Development from Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Tang Prize Foundation and NCKU President Huey-Jen Jenny Su at NCKU, April 3rd.
Endorsed by Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, granted by Tang Prize Foundation and organized by NCKU, the Gro Brundtland Week of Women in Sustainable Development commits to engage outstanding female researchers for public health and sustainable development. It empowers an international platform for collaboration and partnership of female researchers in Taiwan and developing countries.
Dr. Gera is Assistant Professor of Governance and Development in the Political Science Program, College of Social Sciences at the University of the Philippines Cebu, specializing in the evolving structures of governance and their development implications on fragile states, particularly within Asia and the Pacific. She takes immense pride to be receiving an award that bears the name of a globally respected and admired leader, Dr. Gro Brundtland, the pioneer of sustainable development vision that continues to be used as the framework for global decision-making on environmental, social and economic development policy.
Her study examines the implementation of tripartite co-regulation in sustainability monitoring of the coal mining industries in the Philippines and Indonesia. Her findings indicate regulatory capture of monitoring mechanisms by patrimonial interests within the states, creating disincentives for sustainability performance among coal mining corporations.
This regulatory capture stems from the ambivalence of legal frameworks that fragments intergovernmental allocation of regulatory authorities and complicates monitoring systems.
Thus the tri-partite co-regulation could not integrate structures of industry self-regulation and could not institutionalize standard processes for legitimate civil society representation. The study signifies the prevailing pitfalls in both countries’ co-regulation frameworks that are anchored to soft policy instruments by multilateral initiatives and reporting mechanisms, such as the Open Government Partnership initiative, that could not enforce binding sanctions to non-accountability.
Despite scientific evidences of coal’s hazards and dangers to planetary and human health, the coal mining industry is poised to endure particularly with the rising demand in Asia and the developing regions. The use of coal remains central to capital accumulation. Thus, how the industry is managed and regulated, especially in countries with noted weak regulatory capacity by the state, pose critical implications on sustainability. This study contributes to present and future stocktaking of appropriate frameworks for business regulation, particularly the ‘tripartite co-regulation/multi-stakeholder regulation’ to foster collective industry regulation in the midst of state weakness.
The Philippines and Indonesia are two of the leading global suppliers of minerals and ores and hosts to large-scale coal mining industries. However, both were ranked as among the world’s ten worst governments in the Fraser Institute’s Annual Survey of Mining Companies 2016 Policy Perception Index. How the governments arrange institutions and collaborations to regulate mining industries, including mining monitoring to enforce industry and corporate accountability, pose critical implications on achieving sustainable energy and extractive sectors.
UNDP (2014) notes that sustainable development requires a new approach to address the political, not just the technical, aspects of development solutions. It also requires that public officials account for their actions and that mechanisms for collaboration are generated across sectors and promote inclusion.
Her research has examined appropriate policy interventions and governance arrangements that can effectively steer industries and businesses towards sustainable operations beyond compliance of environmental standards. In the context of weak/patrimonial states such as the Philippines and Indonesia, governance specialists would have to rethink about the use of legally non-binding soft policy instruments and voluntary mechanisms of prevailing global multilateral initiatives in enforcing industry accountability and sustainability performance.
Dr. Gera concludes that designing intervention and incentive systems beyond the state that could well integrate and maximize the benefits of private regulation by the industry will be required, as well as institutionalize mechanisms for legitimate civil society representation, to warrant high levels of accountability from public regulation.
“In the Philippines, the female researchers and scientists are as competitive as their male counterparts in terms of scientific productivity,” commented Dr. Gera. “We do share the same access to institutional incentives available, at least based on my professional experience. I should say though that there remain structural barriers depriving many Filipino girls from getting the quality education and scholarship that could give them the agency to be competitive in their chosen profession, if they could choose a profession at all.”
2018 Gro Brundtland Award得主Gera Weena博士來自菲律賓，開心獲獎之餘，她謙虛表示，在永續發展上的微小貢獻獲得肯定，不但具啟發性且鼓舞人心，很高興能與世界各領域做出貢獻的女科學家們共聚一堂。「獲獎提醒自己莫忘更大責任，將在工作上不斷追求卓越，促進包容性發展和社會正義。」
Dr. Gera 感謝前主管聯合國大學全球衛生研究所副所長 Obijiofor Aginam 博士提名並支持她參獎，也感謝他促進主導全球健康和永續發展治理的奉獻，鼓舞人們變強，並把握機會加強回應社會邊緣化族群的需求。
Dr. Gera 的研究考察了三方監管的實施情況，作為監測菲律賓和印尼煤礦行業永續發展表現的手段，主要研究議題是各國在開放政府夥伴聯盟（Open Government Partnership，OGP）框架內永續能源和開採產業的共同監管結構，以及如何加強產業和企業問責制，包括影響該機構的因素，以及國家、產業和民間社會代表共同監督當局的界限。
初步調查結果發現，菲律賓各州實行的槓桿收購和國內世襲利益分配產業利潤有源自法律框架的矛盾性，使監測系統複雜化，從而無法將產業自律監管結構更廣泛地納入公共監督之中，也不能將合法民間社會代表制的標準程序制度化，而這些影響也壓制了煤礦業的永續發展。
Dr. Gera 的研究主要在幫助制定適當的政策，以確保產業對永續發展的責任。在監管能力薄弱的國家，如何管理和監管對該產業的永續性產生重要影響。Dr. Gera 指出，菲律賓和印尼是全球煤礦主要供應商，也是OGP創始成員國，該組織倡議以具體策略實現問責和透明的跨部門合作，確保獲得可負擔、可靠與永續的能源，並且在永續發展的管理框架內，發揮最大的非政府組織監控的潛能。
Dr. Gera 認為，適度的政策干預和治理安排，能有效引導產業和企業走向超越環境標準的永續營運，關鍵在於了解具體國家監管機構相對於產業與民間社會組織的政治背景和能力。設計干預和激勵制度，充分整合並最大限度地提高產業私人監管的效益，並制度化合法民間社會代表機制，以保證公共監管的高度問責性。
Dr. Gera 表示，菲律賓女性研究人員的科學生產力與男性研究人員相比更具有競爭力，「我們確實享有更多更好的獎勵。雖然研究和出版過程需要很長時間，但是對我這樣的單身女性來說，教學和任務也是相當具有挑戰性的」。

8,decent-work-and-economic-growth,NCKU as First University to Offer a Circular Economy Education Program in Taiwan,"Starting from Spring semester 2018, National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) will offer a new education program on Circular Economy. This is in response to the Tsai-Ing Wen government who set Circular Economy as one of her 5+2 spearhead strategies. Taiwan wants to create a more sustainable economy, with a smaller environmental impact on natural resources, as well as less dependence on importing resources. The circular economy focusses on reducing, reusing and recycling with an interesting business model.
The NCKU Circular Economy program is named ‘Circular NCKU’ and it trains students to become the future workforce for companies and governments to innovate from the traditional ‘linear economy’-thinking towards ‘circular economy’-strategies. Competences on circular economy are relevant for any field, therefor the program is shaped as a 15 credit extra-curricular certificate open for students from any master degree. “This also creates the opportunity for a multi-disciplinary program in which students from various masters learn how to collaborate with each other and come to actual integrated solutions, benefitting people, planet and also profit”, says NCKU visiting expert Bart van Bueren. Bart has been teaching at NCKU at 7 different departments over the past 5 years. He is originally from the Netherlands; a country famed of its pioneering into the Circular Economy.
“We also decided to engage more actively with the international student community. As this Circular NCKU program can easily be obtained in one semester, we warmly welcome any foreign exchange students to join this program to obtain the certificate. One way to make that possible, is to ensure all courses are provided in English.” , says prof Hsiao-Wen Wang, the Associate Vice President for International Affairs, who also worked on preparing this program. “NCKU is already offering various courses that include elements for Circular Economy-strategies, these courses are now embedded in the new Circular NCKU program. Additionally, we offer and introduction course to start, and a ‘pilot’ to proof student’s progress.”, prof Wang continues: “The multidisciplinary approach makes it also interesting for companies to collaborate by offering real cases of how their products and services can become more circular.”

成功大學 2018 年 2 月將率全台大學之先，開設15個學分、全英語授課、跨領域的「Circular NCKU（循環經濟國際碩士學分學程）」，預定招收20名學生，除了整合現有的各類循環經濟相關課程外，更將與企業合作共同推動循環經濟，提供學生實際參與的機會，一起解決問題。
Circular NCKU學程歷經1年多的蘊釀，將開放給成大本地、外籍各領域的學生，為學生帶來國際交流與對話的機會，上課時間設定為１學期，交換學生也能修完學分數。學生必修新開3學分的「循環經濟導論」、2學分「循環經濟引導研究」，以及10學分的選修課，修完所需的學分，可獲得循環經濟學分學程證書。詳細資訊可查詢www.circular.ncku.edu.tw.
Circular NCKU學程發起人成大國際事務處副國際長王筱雯指出，過去的經濟發展是「線性經濟」，資源耗費大，然而地球資源有限，為了永續發展，人類社會必需朝「循環經濟」發展，做到資源利用最大化，資源耗竭最小化，政府也已經將循環經濟列為５＋２產業創新計畫的重要政策之一。
長期以來學界雖然開設不少循環經濟相關的課程，但與產業或商業界的連結性較少，Circular NCKU的特色，就在於導入了產業面並提供學生實作解決問題的機會，而且考慮到產業發展牽涉到各個層面，課程領域涵蓋了工學院、電資與資訊學院、規劃與設計學院、管理學院、社會科學院、生科院等。有鑑於循環經濟發展會涉及管理、制度，也安排政經所、政治系、管理學院的教授授課。另外，來自荷蘭致力於循環經濟教學的學者Bart Van Bueren，也會參與課程，要帶給學生歐洲、荷蘭發展永續循環經濟的最新觀點。
王筱雯透露，成大近年來已經開始與台糖、紙業等企業合作，思考學界與企業如何一起推動循環經濟，不少參與學生都覺得很有義意，經常自發性的與老師聚會、議題討論，進而組成學術性的循環經濟學生社團。成大有足夠的能量，師生積極度夠，Circular NCKU水到渠成。

9,industry-innovation-and-infrastructure,Innovation ecosystem launched to revolutionize S. Taiwan business landscape,"As the coronavirus pandemic creates headwinds for many industries in Taiwan, a Tainan university is set to lead an innovation ecosystem in which the government and top tech startups will connect to build innovative momentum and prepare for a business landscape altered by the pandemic and extreme climate change.
The Shalun Ecocity Initiative was launched on Sunday (May 10) by National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), with more than 70 representatives from industries, academia, and government institutions in attendance, according to an NCKU press release. Vice Premier Chen Chi-mai (陳其邁) took part in the launch, pointing to an urgent need to invest in resources and talent to boost economic growth in southern Taiwan.

Meanwhile, construction on the Shalun Smart Green Energy Science City in Tainan is underway and set to integrate 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), and information technology into the applications of smart healthcare, green energy, circular economy, and future transportation. Chen believes that the initiative can complement the science city and that together, they could bring together entrepreneurial teams from Taiwan and around the world to promote innovation and new applications and give local small- and medium-sized enterprises a competitive edge.
Tainan City Mayor Huang Wei-cher (黄偉哲) expressed hope that the science city would become an important base for solar power, wind power, and green architecture in Taiwan and thanked the university for connecting key parties to back the plan.
Over 24 companies from Taiwan, Japan, the United States, and Canada will be joining the initiative and a new platform that supports the mission, according to the press release. Representatives from the university, companies, government agencies, and research institutions gathered together to exchange their ideas and visions on the circular economy, green energy, smart healthcare, and future transportation after the launch ceremony that day.
國立成功大學在未來館舉辦「沙崙智慧產業創新聯盟」成立大會，70多位產官學研高階代表，齊聚一堂，行政院副院長陳其邁與臺南市黃偉哲市長也共襄盛舉，與成大各專門領域的學者們，以及40多位來自台灣、日本、美國，加拿大共24家企業高階代表，針對智慧醫療、循環經濟、未來運輸、減碳綠能四大議題，展開對話與交流，共同商討沙崙綠能科學城的未來展望。成大躬先表率，將擔任執行工作，成立「沙崙綠能智慧創新推動平台」，設「推動委員會」、「政府．企業．大學協力的法人」，確立整體願景目標，執行方向等，形成有效執行的幕僚機制與中央對接，回應政府所擘劃的願景藍圖。陳其邁院長表示，成大在各領域都是頂尖的大學，將是大方南方計畫啟動的大腦，行政院會全力支持成大，支持沙崙智慧產業創新聯盟運作。

成大各專門領域的學者們，以及國內外企業高階代表對話與交流，商討沙崙綠能科學城的未來展望
「沙崙智慧產業創新聯盟」強調大學、產業、政府共構創新生態系，以「台灣智慧解決方案」為動力的國際智慧科技場域及循環生態城鎮的建置，是這個聯盟成立的主要目的。成大將規劃，並且整合中央及地方政府，結合台灣的企業領袖，建構創新研發所需的產官學三螺旋共創機制，拓展校園創新生態系與產業加速對接，以5G、AI、資料交換平台技術，串連到智慧醫療、未來運輸、減碳綠能、循環經濟等應用領域，發展前瞻科技創新，以及實驗場域測試，並且建立資料交換平台智慧化。
成大校長蘇慧貞在成立大會上，首先歡迎產官學各界高階代表蒞臨成大。蘇校長致詞時表示，「當全世界正忙於對抗新冠肺炎疫情，評估其所帶來影響的同時，成大願意伸出援手，轉化研究動能，集結專家學者的智慧與專業，正視持續造成影響的氣候與生態危機，提出振興方案，並且制訂實際可達成的行動方案。在世界經濟、社會、環境都面臨挑戰的今天，成大希望與中央、地方政府以及民間企業，甚至是國際社群站在一起協作，主動規劃，展開行動，擴大投資機會，以刺激經濟，創造就業機會，從南臺灣出發，加速國家規模的綠色轉型計畫，特別是在智慧醫療、循環經濟、未來運輸、減碳綠能四大議題。」

蘇慧貞校長強調，大學是驅動永續發展的社會影響力。蘇校長接著說明，「大學是驅動永續發展的社會影響力，更是創新分工體系中的核心要素，三螺旋的創新機制伴隨著時間推移，也影響著地區創新生態發展，成大扮演著促成智慧循環生態城市發展的關鍵角色，今天我們提出「沙崙智慧產業創新聯盟」的建立，我們的共同願景是建立更加敏捷，更具協作性的推進平台，促成智慧循環生態城市的市場發展，在臺灣實現智慧解決方案。我們攜手前進，因應疫情所帶來的影響，回應全球公衛和環境危機，同時，也積極面對人類社會長遠存續與福祉的關鍵議題。」
蘇校長致詞中提出，聯合國永續發展目標第三項「良好健康與福祉」，在邁向永續未來的道路上，應該兼顧環境、經濟與社會的共好發展，並且確保健康生活，並促進人類福祉。「成大立足於南臺灣，在這座美麗的島嶼上，我們集結產、官、學、研的力道與資源，共同建設沙崙綠能科學城，創造更具活力，宜居，經濟活躍和資源高效的城市。」
行政院副院長陳其邁致詞表示，要開創南臺灣產業新局，活絡經濟，注入活水，就必須投入新創能量及人才，打造新創生力軍。「沙崙智慧綠能科學城」逐步完成各種示範應用建設，都期望與南部在地的創業團隊共同推展新應用，建立地區性創新事業，除了歡迎廠商進駐共同開發綠能科技新應用，未來更希望能吸引更多南部新創能量投入。
陳副院長說，成大在學術創新研發領域上，一直是台灣領導地位，且願意擔負搭建互動交流與技術對接平台角色，結合產業、政府及學術整合，推動成大沙崙智慧產業創新聯盟成型，而且在市長黃偉哲努力下，南科三期陸續到位，在COVID-19之後，工業4.0、先進半導體製程及5G、AI服務解決方案等三大領域，將是台灣主要發展主軸，沙崙成為智慧綠能生態城，更是值得期待。
今日的活動除了聚集產、官、學的重要人士一起宣示「沙崙智慧產業創新聯盟」的成立，更重要的是，四大議題的統整 - 智慧醫療、循環經濟、未來運輸、減碳綠能 - 從領域主題出發，針對各個主題，舉辦一個多小時的平行工作坊，成大推派相對應領域的教授專家，藉由交流討論，希望成大的研究能量能夠與企業的資源對接。成大的行政長官們、領域專家們一起與企業研商，也同步開放給政府相關單位討論，是「沙崙智慧產業創新聯盟」成立的第一步！這個聯盟邀請企業與成大一起合作，後續針對主題對接合作項目，形成行動方案，實際執行，讓研究落地。
成大副校長蘇芳慶在工作坊與企業代表研討時說明，自2010年開始，歐盟每年會選出一座歐洲城市頒予歐洲綠色首都大獎（European Green Capital Award, EGCA），表揚其對都市環境改善以及長期持續提升績效的努力，並做為其它都市的典範，進而推動城市發展的永續經營。
蘇芳慶副校長又以日本「柏之葉大學城」為例，該大學城是由政府、民間、學校聯合的永續城市經營，主要規劃為環境共生都市、 健康長壽都市、新產業 創造都市，創造安心、 安全、永續智慧城市 (Smart City)。
他說，成大對台灣過去的社會經濟建設，佔有舉足輕重的地位，且承擔產業創新、社會價值貢獻等責任，而沙崙智慧綠能科學城可以建構一個生態、永續、科技、創新、共榮、宜居的智慧新市鎮，成大攜手產業、政府，將營造下世代國際學術創新與教育舞台。
臺南市市長黃偉哲表示，成大蘇慧貞校長當領頭羊，結合地方產官學一起努力，將來整個沙崙智慧產業園的發展可期！在蔡英文總統的大南方計劃裡面，沙崙智慧園區應該算是其中已經最接近成熟的，賴清德準副總統早在擔任台南市長的時候，就已經規劃沙崙綠能園區，現在成為智慧產業園區是升級，更是扣合中央的整體的計劃來發展。「綠能科技」是 5+2 產業創新政策中，臺灣能源轉型的關鍵計畫，希望在沙崙智慧綠能科學城，未來能夠促成太陽光電、風力發電、節能、綠建築、智慧電網等綠能科技與產業的快速發展，並吸引智慧服務、新興或新創產業的進駐。
成大副校長蘇芳慶說，成大執行力的證明就是與日本東京電力的合作 ，以及遠傳在沙崙的佈局，他們都是企業校友的牽線與促成，由於成大一直以來產學成績耀眼，扮演臺灣創新的重要推進器與產業研發供應體系樞紐，成大希望掌握先機透過設立地域性群聚，吸引企業及研究機構共同集中發展，打造大學、產業、政府共構創新生態系的「沙崙智慧產業創新聯盟」，推動地區經濟就業，提升在地居民健康福祉，對國際社會作出貢獻。
「沙崙智慧產業創新聯盟」的成軍，將吸引國內外尚未具體成熟，但對未來具影響力的技術，掌握領航企業研發深耕計畫，也可以與能有效影響國內旗艦產業產值與附加價值的關鍵產官學夥伴形成產業聚落，訂立共同目標、制定規範、有效投資、加速升級。

9,industry-innovation-and-infrastructure,Three NCKU Teams Win Big at the 2019 TEL Robot Combat,"In 2019, Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL) organized the TEL Robot Combat event. Three student teams from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), namely The End Game is Getting Rich (總目標是發大財), Déjà vu, and Bright Asparagus Juice (晶晶蘆筍汁), participated in the contest and received Outstanding Creative Technology Award, received Honorable Mention in Creative Technology, and became a Creative Technology finalist, respectively, thus marking the outstanding performance of NCKU students in the contest.
The members of The End Game is Getting Rich were fourth-year electrical engineering students Chen Yueh-ting, Li To-sheng, and Hsieh Wen-Yen and fourth-year mechanical engineering student Huang Chen-wei. The team was awarded the Outstanding Award for Creative Technology for a stylistic video presenting the process through which they created their robot. During TEL preliminary phase of robot combat, teams were required to submit a proposal for approval before constructing their robot. Team member Li stated that the team considered many ambitious ideas when brainstorming during this preparatory phase; after many discussions and trials, they created a cleaning robot that could move with agility across flat spaces.
Their video demonstrated how the robot could assist humans in their daily lives. Controlled by a mobile app, the cleaning robot easily scooped up crumpled up toilet paper and then rapidly climbed uphill to deposit the toilet paper into the waste basket. Team captain Chen recalled that the team members did not argue during the collaborative process. Some parts of the preliminary design were realized, but other parts had to be abandoned. However, throughout the continuous process of trial and improvements, Li believed they “learned many things that aren’t usually taught in class.”
Fourth-year electrical engineering students Chan Chun-hao, Pan Hsin-yu, Hsu Yi-yun, and Huang Pin-hsuan, who formed Team Déjà vu, received the Honorable Mention in Creative Technology. Team captain Chan recalled that to make a breakthrough with their hardware, the team once went for 33 consecutive hours without sleeping. To enter the contest, the team had to adjust and improve on the original design when constructing their robot, and they simultaneously filmed their work progress. During this process, team member Huang realized that “the actual construction was different from the design,” and Chan also stated that “DIY construction of a robot was not as easy as I imagined.”

Electrical engineering professor Cheng Ming-yang was the adviser for teams The End Game is Getting Rich and Déjà vu. The teams included electrical engineering and interdisciplinary students. Team member knowledge was optimized through requisite electrical engineering course assignments; after moving to the next level, the students commenced practical construction of robots and test runways. These students spent their extracurricular time testing and gradually revising their robots’ performance in the hallways and labs of the Electrical Engineering department and in their dormitories. The creation process was constantly documented through video recordings. To assist students and encourage successful participation in the contest, Professor Cheng held intensive discussions with the students and provided venues and equipment to enable the students to test their robots.
TEL was founded in 1963 and is a global leader in the manufacture of equipment for semiconductors and flat panel displays. TEL’s Taiwan subsidiary, Tokyo Electro Taiwan (TEL Taiwan) has organized the TEL Robot Combat since 2016, and this was the fourth such event. The contest continues the spirit of previous events by emphasizing the contestants’ experiences in electrical integration and optimizing the competition’s structure. Competing teams design and construct a robot equipped to negotiate a robot obstacle course. This tests the teams’ creative ideation and technological performance, as well as the mobility, object identification, accuracy, and stability of the robots.

9,industry-innovation-and-infrastructure,NCKU’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics Takes the Lead and Successfully Launches a Two-Stage Hybrid-Propellant Rocket,"The hybrid-propellant rocket development team of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), launched a two-stage hybrid-propellant rocket with 1500-kg thrust in August at Xuhai Coast, Mudan Township, Pingtung. This was the first rocket launch for a Taiwanese academic institution, and the university successfully completed the key technological testing of rocket separation and high altitude ignition. The NCKU’s two-stage hybrid-propellant rocket design outperforms those by the hybrid-propellant rocket teams from other universities, and more crucially, the design, technology, and manufacturing of the critical components and payload instruments are performed by the team or domestically; the rocket production is thus completely independent and self-sufficient.
Professor Chao Yei-Chin of the Department of Aeronautics, who leads an interdisciplinary hybrid-propellant rocket team, suggested that NCKU’s two-stage hybrid-propellant rocket can now leave the laboratory and be launched successfully. NCKU has thus made major breakthroughs in rocket research and technological development, and these breakthroughs can be used in practical rocket design. The hybrid-propellant rocket team increased the thrust from an initial value of 30 kg to 1500 kg, and this indicates that the team has mastered thrust amplification technology. At all other academic institutions in Taiwan, all rocket designs are one-stage designs; the NCKU research team’s two-stage rocket was successfully launched, separated, and ignited at high altitude, indicating that the team’s technology surpasses that developed by all other university teams.
The vast universe has brought infinite imagination to mankind, and countries worldwide compete to develop space technology and explore related industries. Training astronauts is fundamental to this competition. According to Professor Leu Tzong-Shyng, director of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the Third Space Technology Long-Term Development Plan of the Executive Yuan will devote NT$25.1 billion to creating a national team for the Taiwanese space industry, increasing the need for space technology talent. NCKU’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics has not only excellent research standards and ability in the aviation field but also outstanding teaching, research, and talent cultivation in the space field; these capacities mean the university can effectively promote the development of aerospace science and technology and industrial upgrading.
NCKU’s hybrid-propellant rocket research teams previously focused on one-stage rockets. The advantage of a two-stage rocket is that when the first stage section runs out of fuel, the oxidant storage and engine are no longer functional, which becomes an extra weight to the rocket and reduces the subsequent acceleration. The use of rocket separation technology can reduce the rocket’s weight and achieve higher speed and altitude than use of a large one-stage rocket. However, such technology complicates the entire rocket manufacturing and operation. The air is thin and the temperature low at high altitude; reignition under these conditions requires certain technological breakthroughs.
Professor Chao indicated that when their rocket was launched, his team tracked the trajectory of its high dynamic attitude throughout the day. The data revealed that in the first stage, the 1500-kg-thrust rocket engine was operating normally, and the rocket separation and second stage ignition function were normal, achieving the index results. This showed that NCKU has made advancements in the development of a rocket body and systems related to rocket launch.

Professor Chao’s team launched a two-stage rocket with a total length of 5.57 m, diameter of 34 cm, weight of 264 kg, and thrust of 1500 kg on August 7 at Xuhai Coast, Mudan Township, Pingtung. This was the largest-thrust hybrid-propellant rocket launched since the team had first completed a rocket launch test.
Professor Leu stated that space technology requires interdisciplinary cooperation. In NCKU, the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Department of Electrical Engineering, Department of Earth Sciences, Institute of Space and Plasma Sciences, Institute of Physics, and various colleges such as the College of Engineering, College of Science, and College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science have gained good mutual understanding. These departments and colleges teach the theoretical basis of rocket launching and provide comprehensive courses and training for satellite system integration. They have also developed outstanding research capacity and achieved excellent research outcomes.
In terms of research on rockets required for satellite launches and microthrusters required for satellite attitude control, NCKU was the first university in Taiwan to devote research to a hybrid-propellant rocket propulsion system. The 30-kg-thrust hybrid-propellant rocket launched by Professor Chao’s team in 2009 was the first successfully launched hybrid-propellant rocket in Taiwan. Additionally, the team successfully launched a 1000-kg-thrust hybrid-propellant rocket in 2015 and 1500-kg-thrust two-stage hybrid rocket in 2019.
NCKU’s research team from the Institute of Space and Plasma Sciences participated in the Exploration of Energization and Radiation in Geospace (ERG) satellite project of Japan and formed an ERG Taiwan team with Academia Sinica. The Taiwan team is devoted to studying the payload for measuring the low energy electron distribution in the ERG satellite. The team is independent and self-reliant in the process from design, development, and production to subsequent data format setting. NCKU’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics self-designed and developed the 2-kg Phoenix Cube Satellite, setting a new milestone for the development of aerospace technology in Taiwan. Jordan Vannitsen, a French student who participated in the Phoenix Cube Satellite development, established a space startup in Taiwan and participated in the European Space Agency's business proposal competition, winning the grand prize of 500,000 euros.

9,industry-innovation-and-infrastructure,aiRobots Laboratory of NCKU’s Department of Electrical Engineering Won Three Championships at the RoboWorld Cup at the First Entry,"The 24th Federation of International Robot-Soccer Association (FIRA) World Cup Smart Robot Competition in 2019 was held at the Changwon Exhibition Convention Center in Busan, South Korea, from August 12 to 16. A total of 147 people from the Pro. Team and 52 people from the Youth Team represented Taiwan in various robot events. The aiRobots team of the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), participating in the competition for the first time, won three championships, breaking historical records.
This competition was established with reference to the World Cup soccer system, and the appearance and movement of the robots in the competition are similar to those of human soccer players. The competition has gradually become popular among adolescents in recent years. Taiwan had 17 teams of 52 people participating in the youth group this year. Professor Li Tzuu Hseng S., the director of the Center for Intelligent Robotics and Automation, NCKU, and a distinguished professor of the Department of Electrical Engineering, is a crucial promoter of participation in the robot soccer game. In 2009, Professor Li was invited by Prof. Jong-Hwan Kim (Dean of the College of Engineering, KAIST), FIRA’s Founding Chairman, to create a 3-versus-3  humanoid robot soccer game named Android Soccer Tournament (AndroSot). Professor Li was the chairman and chief judge of this competition for several years and did not allow his student team to participate in the competition to prevent claims of bias. Because he decided to hand over the position to a young Korean professor this year, NCKU student teams were able to register and participate in the competition for the first time.

Smart robots can not only play soccer individually but also form teams to participate in matches. Professor Li, with a serious expression but half joking, stated that “both humans and robots will compete in soccer games in full accordance with the rules of the FIFA [Fédération Internationale de Football Association] World Cup in 2050, and the robot team will defeat the human team.” He listed examples to explain why this may be possible: “Armstrong landed on the moon in the early twentieth century, and the idea was proposed half a century before it was accomplished. Another story is about the invention of the computer. Development of a computing processor with memory function only began in the 1940s and 1950s, and the whole computer had the size of two to three rooms at the time. Nevertheless, a parallel operation computer named Deep Blue was able to defeat the world chess champion by 1997.” Professor Li emphasized that no problem exists strategically; the most challenging task is to create an emulation robot that has the same body shape and weight as an ordinary person. Moreover, soccer teams must be found who are willing to compete with robots. In the future, more advanced materials will be available, and robots’ muscle contraction can be made nearly identical to that in humans.
“Strategy should be emphasized during the competition, and this is the same for baseball and soccer. On the soccer field, people are constantly looking through a tbinocularselescope to provide No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3 team formation changes at any time, but having an individual who observes the whole field is crucial.” Professor Li suggested that robots also have personality; for example, the motors used in mechanical operation of a robot can vary, causing differences in speed or direction of action, with the robot’s default program responding accordingly.
The main players from NCKU who participated in the competition were four undergraduate students (Wang Chang-Wen, Yang Cheng-Yeh, Liu En-Hao, and Chou I-Ting) and two graduate students (Luan Po-Chien and Chang Chien-Hsin). The AndroSot competition comprised three events: the first challenge event (dribble and attack), second challenge event (free attach), and 3-versus-3 AndroSot Soccer.
When they returned to Taiwan after the competition, the team members have remained in the aiRobots laboratory to continue researching and modifying the relevant robot programs, even sleeping at the laboratory occasionally. The team’s goal is to participate in the competition again next year and perform even more highly. During a smart robot soccer game, the robots occasionally collide and then fall over before quickly standing up, and some goalkeepers throw themselves at the ball to block it from entering the goal, which is fascinating and has attracted the attention of numerous students. The laboratory has simulation sites, and global lenses are installed on the ceiling. Real-time video is sent to computers next to the soccer field. Subsequently, a computer program automatically formulates a strategy after calculation and analysis and quickly sends instructions to the chip on each robot through wireless transmission.

9,industry-innovation-and-infrastructure,NCKU Alumna Wins Boat International Young Designer of the Year Award 2019,"Yih-harn Liu, the alumna of NCKU’s Department of System and Naval Mechatronic Engineering, entered Boat International’s yacht design competition and won the Young Designer of the Year Award 2019, becoming the first Taiwanese to win a major award in the international yacht community. Professor Ming-Chung Fang, her advisor during her undergraduate and postgraduate studies, expressed his pride in Yih-harn Liu: “Yih-harn is very talented, and even more importantly, she is hard-working and an avid learner. I knew back then that she would make it big one day!”
Yih-harn Liu, who pursued both her bachelor’s degree and her master’s degree at the Department of System and Naval Mechatronic Engineering at NCKU, is a great lover of boats and the sea. She loves sharing pictures of boats and the ocean as well as pictures of herself on boats and at competitions on her Facebook page. After obtaining her master’s degree in 2016, she studied yacht design and interior design at Italy and the UK. Winning this major international award in the yacht community, Yih-harn Liu expressed with excitement that it was a great recognition and encouragement and that she was thankful to NCKU for helping her build a solid foundation.
Yih-harn Liu further indicated that NCKU is a comprehensive university with a wide selection of courses, which is rare in Taiwan. Students can take courses based on their interests and their future goals and needs. In addition to the required and elective courses that she took at the Department of System and Naval Mechatronic Engineering during her undergraduate studies, she also took a statistics course at the Department of Accountancy and learned design and hand-drawing at the Department of Industrial Design. “The knowledge and skills that I gained from these courses may not seem to be directly connected to yacht design, but they more or less helped me when I analyzed problems, did projects, and made decisions, so I could look at problems from a more rational angle and use more mature methods to express my designs.”
Professor Jeng-Horng Chen at NCKU’s Department of System and Naval Mechatronic Engineering, who taught Yih-harn Liu engineering graphics, thermodynamics, and basic ship design in the first, second, and fourth years of her undergraduate studies, observed that Yih-harn held high self-expectations and was generally at the top of her class. He was particularly impressed with her performance in the fourth-year basic ship design course. “The level of the project that her group turned in that year was far beyond what was required. They used a number of additional tools and skills, and their s hip configurations displayed considerable ingenuity. Much of it was clearly the result of active learning.” They even fabricated a company name and designed a logo; you could see their ambition to do their best. Their project was practically what you would find in the industry, and no other students have surpassed them so far.” Jeng-Horng Chen still has that project today, and whenever any student complains that the project is too hard to do, he shows them the project, which brings gasps of astonishment.
Ming-Chung Fang explained that Yih-harn had aimed toward yacht design early on. Aside from working on her schoolwork, she also served as the vice president of the NCKU sailing club and competed in sailing races, which gave her experience in navigation and deepened her knowledge and understanding of yachts. After obtaining her master’s degree at NCKU, she went abroad to further her studies and courageously marched onward toward her goal. “She is constantly nourishing her life progress, and this award is the fruit of her considerable efforts and preparation.”
Chairman Sheng-Chih Shen of the Department of System and Naval Mechatronic Engineering stressed that NCKU offers many opportunities for cross-disciplinary learning. In addition to their engineering education, students at the Department of System and Naval Mechatronic Engineering are also welcome to take classes at the College of Planning and Design if they are interested in design, drawing, or aesthetics. For years, there has been no shortage of system and naval mechatronic engineering majors pursuing their master’s in design, and students in the Department of Industrial Design have also found research collaborations between their advisors and professors at the Department of System and Naval Mechatronic Engineering. Furthermore, NCKU has many departments and a diverse selection of student clubs to help students cultivate their skills in coordination, problem-solving, and management and expand their social networks. Yih-harn’s achievement is the best example of the advantages offered by NCKU’s diverse learning environment.
Boat International received a record high of 42 entries for the Young Designer of the Year Award 2019. Entrants were required to design and create the general plans for an 80-meter motor sailer . After two rounds, only six entrants from five countries, namely Italy, Turkey, Taiwan, the UK, and China, made it into the finals.
The Young Designer of the Year Award, which targets young yacht designers, is presented during the Boat International Design & Innovation Awards and has long been co-sponsored by Boat International magazine and superyacht builder Oceanco. Other award categories include best exterior styling, best interior design, and best naval architecture, and they are like the Oscar Awards of the yacht community.
成大系統及船舶機電工程系校友劉奕涵，參加 Boat International 國際遊艇設計競賽，一舉奪下 The Young Designer of the Year Award 2019（2019年遊艇設計新秀獎），是台灣首位在國際遊艇界獲得重要大獎者，當年大學部導師及碩士論文指導教授方銘川與有榮焉，談到劉奕涵有著滿滿的驕傲，「奕涵，有天份，但更重要的是她很認真，積極主動學習，我早就看好她！」
大學、碩士均就讀成大系統及船舶機電工程系的劉奕涵，愛海、喜歡船，臉書上有許多船與大海的圖片，更不乏她登遊艇出航、比賽的照片。2016年取得碩士學位後先後到義大利、英國攻讀遊艇設計與室內設計。摘下國際遊艇界重要大獎，劉奕涵興奮地說，這是很大的肯定與鼓勵，要感謝成大為她奠下的紮實基礎。
劉奕涵表示，成大是台灣少數具備完整領域課程的綜合型大學，學生可以依照興趣及未來目標與需求修習。在大學期間除了系統及船舶機電工程系的必選修課外，她也到會計系修習統計學，到工設系了解設計概論及手繪技巧，「這些知識與技巧看似和遊艇設計並無直接關聯，但在分析問題、執行專案和判斷決策時或多或少帶來幫助，讓我用更理性的角度切入問題並採取更成熟的方法表現設計。」
分別在大一、大二、大四教過劉奕涵工程圖學、熱力學以及船舶設計基礎的成大系統及船舶機電工程系副教授陳政宏說，奕涵自我期許很高，課業向來名列前茅，大四船舶設計基礎的表現更是令老師驚艷。「當年她那一組交的作業，水準遠遠超越要求，繪圖上用了不少額外的工具與技巧，船舶配置亦有巧思，看得出很多都是主動學習來的。此外，還虛擬公司名稱、設計LOGO，在在展現要做到最好的企圖心。那份作業程度幾乎到達業界要求，目前為止仍無學弟妹可超越。」這份報告至今他仍留著，每當有學生哀嚎作業太難，只要出示就引來一陣驚嘆與佩服。
方銘川表示，奕涵很早就確定要朝「遊艇設計」發展，注重課業外，大學期間也擔任成大帆船社副社長，為社團拓展許多活動及社務，也出航遊玩、參加帆船比賽，累積航海經驗並深化對遊艇的認識與體會。取得成大碩士後，跳脫舒適圈赴國外進修，為了目標勇往直前。「她不斷為人生發展添加養份，得獎是無數努力和準備的成果。」
系統及船舶機電工程系主任沈聖智指出，成大有許多跨域學習的機會，系統及船舶機電工程系的學生除了學習工科專業，對設計、繪圖或美學有興趣者，也能到規劃與設計學院修工設系的課程。多年來，不乏系統系的學生報考工設系研究所，也有學生在工設系找到指導教授與系統系的教授一起做遊艇相關的研究題目。此外，成大還有不同科系、豐富多元的的學生社團，培養協調與解決問題與管理的能力、拓展人際關係等。奕涵的表現，最能顯示出成大多元學習環境帶來的正面影響。
Boat International 2019年遊艇設計新秀獎（The Young Designer of the Year Award 2019），共42名年輕設計師參加，是有史以來最多的一屆，參賽者以80公尺長的動力帆船為主題做整體設計與規劃，每件作品都極具水準，經過2輪評審，最後只有義大利、土耳其、台灣、英國、中國等5國6名參賽者進入決賽。劉奕涵作品線條優雅、動線簡潔俐落，整體設計與配置精確，繪圖細緻，擊敗眾好手，抱回首獎。
The Young Designer of the Year Award，是 Boat Inertnational 雜誌公司在 The Boat International Design & Innovation Award 盛會期間與超級遊艇廠 Oceanco 長期合作贊助的獎項，該獎項主要對象為年輕遊艇設計師。其他尚有針對實船外型、遊艇室內設計、造船工等領域設置的獎項，有如遊艇界的奧斯卡獎。

9,industry-innovation-and-infrastructure,NCKU Joins Hands with Sampo Corporation and Rechi Precision to Create a Common Research Center for Smart Home Appliances,"NCKU’s joint venture with Sampo Corporation and the Rechi Precision Company was made official after NCKU’s president Dr. Huey-Jen Jenny Su, Sampo chairman Sheng-tian Felix Chen, and Rechi Precision’s vice chairman Jin-Hsi Liu signed a memorandum for establishing a cooperative research center on the 18th. The collaboration will bring together the fortes and energies from all three establishments. In order to get the pulse of current needs, specifically solutions for improving future smart homes and new kinds of compressor technologies, manufacturing processes, and product chains, the first step in the process will be to field applications and proposals for creative and cutting edge research projects. The new research center will be a training ground for up-and-coming talent from the fields of science, engineering, design development, and management. Together they will work in tandem and push forward in the smart home appliance industry and create a new future for home living.
The signing ceremony took place at NCKU. Those who bore witness to the signing include the chairperson of the Executive Yuan’s Ocean Affairs Council as well as former NCKU president Hwung-Hweng Hwung, Sampo president Lien-Chun Chen (陳連春) and vice president Cheng-Min Yang(楊正民), Rechi Precision president Ming-Fa Feng and his director of research and development Hsi-Kun Hsu (徐錫崑), NCKU director of research and development Sun-Yuan Hsieh, NCKU’s Transfer and Incubation Center vice chairman Ming-Chin Hou (侯明欽), Woei-Shyan Lee (李偉賢), and the guest speaker Professor Fan-Tien Cheng.
NCKU president Dr. Huey-Jen Jenny Su touted the significance of this collaboration, saying that the center will provide a common platform on which both new and veteran teachers can work together towards a common goal. For the last 90 years since its founding, NCKU has stayed its course in upholding its values and mission while solidifying its foundation on which the school has grown. Dr. Su personally thanked Sampo and Rechi Precision for their many years of support to NCKU but said that they all must now focus on forging a new path of development for NCKU in the areas of energy, artificial intelligence, and industrial development. Moreover, social sciences and medicine will also be incorporated into the mix so that students can gain a deeper understanding of the humanities and find more opportunities in the future.
Sampo chairman Felix Chen once said: “Invest in Vietnam? Why not invest in Tainan?”. The chairman half-jokingly cited Tainan’s good air quality and tantalizing food scene as reasons for moving operations to Tainan. But food and air quality aside, the chairman was pleased to see this collaborative project finally launch after a lengthy period of planning and preparation. As a champion of establishing roots at home, the chairman expressed his hope that NCKU will be a power source to spark higher levels of innovation. Rechi Precision vice chairman Jin-Hsi Liu is a firm believer in a company’s sustainable growth in the way of continuously innovating new products, developing technologies, and onboarding new talent. He has high hopes that this collaborative partnership will be a long-lasting and sustainable one.
NCKU is a comprehensive school and research institution for the sciences. It was globally ranked by Thomson Reuters for its volume of academic papers in the field of electric home appliances. Domestically, NCKU is ranked number one in this regard. Be it energy planning, green energy development, artificial intelligence, or industrial design, all these fields have immense growth potential. The Global Research & Industry Alliance (GLORIA) will also help shoulder responsibilities of helping bottlenecked companies quickly find breakthroughs in the form of academic resources and at the same time establish a direct pipeline between NCKU talent and the industry at large, which will accelerate the establishment of the connection between Taiwan’s smart home appliances and the international market.
Taiwan’s major manufacturer of electric home appliances Sampo Corporation was founded in 1936. Throughout the many decades, Sampo has made itself into a household name. Sampo’s chairman Felix Chen, its president Lien-Chun Chen and vice president Cheng-Min Yang are also all NCKU alumni. With Sampo’s new manufacturing center soon to be completed in the Tainan Technology Industrial Park Service Center, the area will soon experience a boom in its need for new talent. The future of Sampo manufacturing will center around energy conservation as well as a healthy and green internet of things connecting home appliances and AI-related products. The accompanying technologies will feature highly integrated home appliance systems which allow voice-command initiated or the remote control of in-home lighting systems, air conditioning and heating, and audiovisual electronics among others. The system can take appropriate actions with these appliances depending on the home’s environment which it can detect via sensors, making home living more convenient than ever while meeting energy conservation and environmental needs.
Rechi Precision Company was founded in 1989. Having a close pulse on the electric home appliances industry, it is currently an air conditioning compressor industry leader as the world’s number four in compressor manufacturing. Rechi Precision has also worked closely with NCKU for many years and has spared little resources to train up new talent. In the past three years alone, the company has donated $3 million NTD in student scholarships. From 2015 to date, it has been avidly promoting the Masters program in the Design of Electrical Machinery under NCKU’s Department of Electrical Engineering and spurring collaborations between academia and industry. In addition, the company offers NCKU students plentiful internships and organizes group tours of its factories in the Mainland with the aim of giving students a deeper look into how enterprises operate while engaging in technological exchanges and broadening their world view. Rechi Precision Company also offers NCKU graduates a chance to get involve in the global market in the form of employment opportunities.

9,industry-innovation-and-infrastructure,NCKU and Qisda Join Hands in Creating Future Smart University City,"On November 20, NCKU and Qisda Corporation signed a Smart Campus Collaboration Memorandum in agreement to combine each other’s advantages and energy to integrate teaching, research, and living infrastructure management via technologies such as the internet, cloud services, and big data analysis. They aim to incorporate these b asics into the design and operation model of smart cities in the future and expand them to neighboring businesses and communities so as to co-create and experience smart living and build a miniature smart city as an innovative and empirical demonstration.
The signing ceremony of the memorandum was hosted by the Global Research & Industry Alliance,NCKU (GLORIA NCKU) at the old library on NCKU’s Sheng-Li Campus, and NCKU president Dr. Huey-Jen Jenny Su and Qisda chairman and CEO Peter Chen were the signatory representatives. In her speech, Dr. Huey-Jen Jenny Su indicated that they at NCKU should do what changes society and the future and imagine what future society, new lifestyles, and industry opportunities should be like. She stated that their objective is to develop a smart campus starting from energy and healthcare. NCKU has been progressing steadily for the past eighty to ninety years, and smart campuses and cities are the new trend. NCKU must become a base of innovation for smart cities and make efforts and breakthroughs for the land and city they reside in. Qisda chairman and CEO Peter Chen explained that beginning with the hardware and software, Qisda has been developing the brain for a smart campus using artificial intelligence and the internet of things to realize a future smart university city. They also hope to share their smart university city experience with Tainan City to create a smart city and enrich future life.
An international research institute proposed the core elements of a smart campus include smart learning, smart social communities, smart governance, smart healthcare, smart management, and smart green energy. Through academia-industry collaboration, NCKU and Qisda will integrate campus energy conservation facilities, environment monitoring, course arrangement, personnel safety, and teacher and student health. Qisda will assist NCKU in incorporating artificial intelligence and the internet of things to integrate and activate their central management platform, effectively connect and apply on- and off-campus resources and systems, and create a smart city with the aspects of future life. NCKU is a hall of innovation for knowledge transfer and research. Artificial intelligence and the internet of things can facilitate the collection and analysis of big data for campus innovation and research and help turn this smart university city into a miniature demonstration for smart cities.
In recent years, many research teams at NCKU have invested in smart campus installation and relevant research. For example, Professor Tzu-Ping Lin of the Department of Architecture has been setting up a smart sensor network to measure temperature, humidity, and air quality indexes such as PM2.5 and carbon dioxide concentration throughout the campus and provide the information in real-time so as to establish a campus climate map with air-quality monitoring. In the Department of Urban Planning, Professor Wei-Ju Huang has designed CK-Forum, an online teaching platform that uses a cloud collaboration platform to achieve teaching innovation. In addition to strong interactivity and instant communication, it can digitally record and preserve discussion processes across time and space. The ESCO system developed by the energy system management team at the Department of Electrical Engineering uses a reservation function to remotely control energy use and also has a facial recognition function for convenient and secure access control, which achieves energy conservation management and space intelligentization. NCKU is also the first university to have a campus bike network, CK-Bike, which is also a motion detection vehicle. The bikes have embedded chips that collect data for better traffic safety on campus.

9,industry-innovation-and-infrastructure,The First Agricultural UAV,"Guided by Prof. Wei Hsiang, Lai (Dept. of Aeronautics & Astronautics) and Prof. Chaur Shiuh, Young (Dept. of Accountancy), Earthgen Tech developed the first agricultural drone in Taiwan. It provides farmers with the advantage of introducing high-efficiency self-developed agricultural unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for pesticide spraying. The UAV has advantages that include uniformity and high spraying efficiency, and its atomizing nozzle can refine pesticide particle size to enhance absorbtion by crops, thus effectively reducing the amount of pesticide used. This has the potential to solve the serious problem of rural labor shortage and the Taiwan “Brain drain.” The development of a UAV team can provide rural jobs that require professional and highly technical skills to attract young people back to their Taiwan home. This technology also improves the efficiency and safety of farmers resulting in added value. Success achieved in this program it is proof of concept and will be possible to transfer it to other fields, thus creating a sustainable, friendly environment for Taiwan’s agricultural industry.

9,industry-innovation-and-infrastructure,Intelligent Manufacturing and Industry 4.1,"Over time, due to its growth as an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and ODM (original design manufacturer), Taiwan has developed an irreplaceable base of strength in the global manufacturing industry chain, The achievements are obvious and well recognized in the global market. in the face of demand for changes in the digital production line, Taiwanese manufacturers are feeling pressure to move product production towards a lower degree of quantity and customization. To become more flexible in terms of production, Taiwanese firms must rely on intelligent software development, helping to initiate the industry 4.1 wave.
Industry 4.0 typically stresses improving corporate productivity, but there is less emphasis on quality. This makes it impossible for factories to achieve the goal of zero defects due to a lack of an affordable, practical online real-time total inspection system. Professor Fan-Tien Cheng (Dept. of Computer Science and information Engineering) and his innovative Automatic Virtual Metrology (AVM) technology can achieve the near zero defect goal because AVN can provide information and data for products online in real-time. When defects are found, the defective product can be screened out. Through this method, almost all deliverables will have zero defects. The defective products will go through the Key-variable Search Algorithm (KSA) to pinpoint the main cause so problems can be resolved. The improvements are continuous, eventually accomplishing the near zero defect goal with most products.
In 2018, the Intelligent Manufacturing Research Center (iMRC) was established at NCKU, using the AVM technology to develop the Advanced Manufacturing Cloud of Things industries and help achieve the goal of nearly zero defects for all of their products.

9,industry-innovation-and-infrastructure,Professor Wu Develops a Tool That Contributes to Major Breakthrough in C.elegans Research,"As a C.elegans researcher, Professor Wei-Sheng Wu at the Department of Electrical Engineering in National Cheng Kung University recognized the need for a fast and user-friendly tool to aid in C.elegans research. With his master’s student Wei-Che Huang, he thus developed the web tool piScan and helped a research team in Chicago make a breakthrough. They now have the chance to solve a genetic mystery that has baffled C.elegans researchers for more than two decades. Their achievements are published in the February issue of Science in 2018, and the article is expected to capture the attention of C.elegans researchers around the world and exert a significant impact.
The corresponding author of this article in Science, “The piRNA targeting rules and the resistance to piRNA silencing in endogenous genes”, is Professor Heng-Chi Lee of the University of Chicago, and Professor Wu and Wei-Che Huang are co-authors. Professor Wu is devoted to designing bio-databases and developing bioinformatics web tools. Unable to tolerate things that cannot be used or understood, he insists that all of the tools produced in his laboratory must be “simple, functional, but not fancy.” Users only need to open a webpage, choose the settings, and execute. They do not need to install any programs and can obtain results even for people who cannot write any programs.” These tools are exactly what researchers have wanted.
Wu originally specialized in communication systems in graduate school. While pursuing his doctorate degree, however, he decided to follow his mentor, Professor Bor-Sen Chen at the Department of Electrical Engineering in National Tsing Hua University, to cross over into the field of systems biology. By continuously improving himself and his expertise, Wu was able to accumulate enough biological knowledge, and he immediately hit it off with Lee. “We met at a Chinese New Year party held by the University of Chicago Taiwanese Student Association in the January of 2017. Maybe it was because we were both Taiwanese; we decided to collaborate really quickly. Heng-Chi Lee is a post-doctor of Nobel Prize winner Craig Mello. If you don’t have a strong background in biology, you won’t understand what he wants. It was just the perfect conditions for this international collaboration.”
Wu indicated that there is new knowledge to be gained every day. All modern biologists will have to conduct big data analyses at one time or another to derive further conclusions, which makes program development even more important. He regards the development of each program as a process of giving birth to new life and exercises utmost care. In regards to Wei-Che Huang, who was responsible for writing the program, Wu expressed strong praise. “He contributed enormously to this project. He originally had no experience at all but overcame a number of difficulties through self-learning.”
Mild-mannered and reserved, Huang never imagined that his accomplishments would be published in Science. He jokes that he is most thankful for Professor Wu breaking down his neck all the way. “Professor Wu is really different. Most of the time, grad students only see their advisors during meetings, but Professor Wu is at the lab checking our progress and discussing things with us every day, sometimes even on holidays.” With strict and meticulous Wu as his advisor, Huang admitted that there were agonizing days, but he never thought about quitting. Feeling fortunate to have undergone such training, he has gained a strong sense of accomplishment.
Even before its official launch, piScan has already received much attention from C.elegans researchers. Wu indicated that C.elegans researchers have been trying to use reporter genes in the past but were hindered by piRNA recognition, an intracellular defense mechanism. This problem has confronted C.elegans researchers for more than 20 years. Lee found the targeting logic of piRNA in C.elegans to explain why foreign nucleic acids are generally silenced after entering C.elegans germline cells. With piScan, the nucleic acid sequences of fluorescent protein can be changed to escape piRNA targeting, which results in the successful fluorescent protein expression. Thus, C.elegans researchers will be able to insert the nucleic acid sequences that they want to be expressed in C.elegans. In other words, based on the targeting rules of piRNA, researchers can successfully find the sequences they want to be expressed and modify them. “What originally could not be expressed could now successfully be expressed. This is a major breakthrough for biologists.”
As stated in Issue 555 of the Science Monthly, “There are more than 10,000 papers on C. elegans, and six scientists have received Nobel Prizes for research on C.elegans”. This shows that there are numerous C.elegans researchers, and Wu’s achievement will assist them in solving more mysteries in C.elegans genetics.
成大電機工程系教授吳謂勝帶領碩士班學生黃偉哲，站在使用者角度了解線蟲生物學家需求，「要人性化、速度也要夠快」，順利開發出簡便好用的網頁工具piScan，協助芝加哥大學研究團隊找到突破關鍵，可望解開困擾線蟲生物學家20多年的序列謎團，研究成果登上2018年2月《Science》期刊，預期將受到全球線蟲生物學家關注，極具影響力。
這篇榮登《Science》的論文「The rules for piRNA targeting reveal resistance of endogenous genes to piRNA silencing in C. elegans」，通訊作者是美國芝加哥大學李亨啓教授，吳謂勝與黃偉哲為共同作者。吳謂勝教授擅於設計生物資料庫及開發生物資訊網頁工具，「無法容忍看不懂或不能用的狀況」，所有出自他實驗室的工具，一定要「簡單、功能到位但不花俏，只要會使用瀏覽器開啟網頁，選按條件、執行，不需要安裝程式，即使電腦程式功力不佳，也能透過這個工具獲得結論。」完全說中使用者心聲。
原本碩士班專長在通訊的吳謂勝，唸博士班時毅然決然跟隨恩師清大電機系陳博現教授跨足系統生物學，靠著自我不斷精進，提高專業層次，點滴累積生物知識才能夠和李亨啓一拍即合。「2017年1月，我們在美國芝加哥大學台灣同學會春節聚餐上相識，可能因為同是台灣人所以很快就決定合作，李亨啓是諾貝爾獎得主Craig Mello門生，沒有深厚的生物底子很難搞懂他要什麼，此次跨國合作可說是天時地利加上人和。」
吳謂勝指出，知識日新月異，現代生物學家多少都必要透過巨量分析獲得進一步結論，開發程式越顯重要，他把每個程式開發都當作孕育生命的過程，全心呵護。提到這次負責寫程式的學生黃偉哲，吳謂勝教授大力讚賞「他貢獻很大，從原本完全沒有經驗，經過自學克服許多難關。」
溫文靦腆的黃偉哲做夢都沒想過自己的研究成果能登上《Science》，他笑說最感謝吳老師一路緊迫盯人，「老師很不一樣，一般研究生通常都是meeting的時候才會和指導教授見面，但是吳老師是每天、甚至假日都到實驗室關心我們的進度，一起討論。」面對細心又嚴格的吳老師雖然有過痛苦的日子，黃偉哲卻沒想過要放棄，他說很幸運能有這段很好的訓練，覺得很有成就感。
piScan這個網頁工具還未公開發表，就已經備受線蟲生物學家關注。吳謂勝指出，過去線蟲生物學家想使用報導基因（reporter gene）來進行研究，會因為被細胞內的防禦機制piRNA所辨認並受到抑制而無法表現，許多研究因此無法順利進行，這問題已經困擾線蟲生物學家20年。李亨啓找出線蟲中piRNA的結合法則，可以解釋為何外來核酸進到線蟲生殖細胞後通常表現都會受到抑制，進一步透過piScan這個工具，則可以更改螢光蛋白的核酸序列，以逃脫piRNA的結合而能成功表達螢光蛋白，讓線蟲生物學家可以輸入他們想在線蟲表達的核酸序列。也就是說，根據piRNA的結合法則，順利找出想要表現的序列並修正序列。「本來沒辦法成功表現的因此能順利表現，對生物學家而言將可說是震撼性突破。」
根據《科學月刊》第555期提到，「以線蟲為主題的研究論文就有超過上萬篇，甚至還有6位科學家，因線蟲研究而獲頒諾貝爾獎。」足見線蟲生物學家者眾，吳謂勝的開發成果，有助於揭開更多線蟲基因的奧秘。

9,industry-innovation-and-infrastructure,AIS&D Marks a Milestone Achievement in AI Development,"The launch of the AI service and data center (AIS&D) on December 26, 2017 confirms the position of National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) as a leader in the field of artificial intelligence. This latest development is the most recent in a proud history: in 1934, the students of the Dept. of Mechanical Engineering successfully built a counting robot; eighty-three years later, the establishment of the AIS&D is a bold declaration of the university’s ongoing commitment to AI research and applications. As the bellwether in the AI field, NCKU has further extended its reach by signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Tainan City Government regarding smart city development.
At the opening ceremony, the AI self-driving car built by NCKU was exhibited outside the venue. With the exception of the auto-body, the creation of this vehicle, including all technologies and applications of artificial intelligence, comprising the sensory devices, judgment and decision-making, driving control, and systemic integration, was achieved by the NCKU-based multidisciplinary team. Vehicle dynamics will be tested at the Guiren campus next year. In commemoration of NCKU’s robotic achievements in 1934, the students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering created a voice-controlled counting robot using industrial waste, with the aim of counting the visitors to the anniversary exposition.
AIS&D has allocated TWD 7 million dollars to the “super computer,” or NVIDIA DGX-1 GPU, which is targeted at the in-depth learning and accelerated analysis of artificial intelligence. Its computing performance equals that of 250 traditional servers, with a total bandwidth of
DGX-1, and speed of 768GB per second.
The AIS&D was founded to provide AI services and assistance to all departments of the university as well as conduct its own AI research through industry-government-academia collaboration and big-data analysis. Relevant curriculum will be provided in the near future.
The R&D director, Sun-Yuan Hsieh, spoke of the three core missions of AIS&D. The center is intended first to provide support for the university’s AI research and development, including intelligent manufacturing, intelligent robots, intelligent aquaculture, and intelligent healthcare. Second, the AIS&D is initiating a collaborative project with Tainan City Government to address the issues of a smart city, digital governance, civil servants’ professional empowerment and big-data analysis. Third, the AIS&D will concentrate on using and analyzing the big data collected for NCKU’s smart campus, in order to improve the environment for both educational and research functions.
The dean of EECS, Wei-Chou Hsu, pointed out that all the colleges of NCKU have been making concerted effort to employ artificial intelligence in various fields, such as intelligent manufacturing, self-driving cars, detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis, analysis of orchid breeding and greenhouse growing systems, long-term care robots, and financial technologies. In short, the AIS&D will not only reap academic results, but also offer valuable help to the industrial and public sectors.
The president of NCKU, Huey-Jen Su, current acting mayor of Tainan, Meng-Yen Lee, and the abovementioned Sun-Yuan Hsieh, and Wei-Chou Hsu jointly participated in the opening ceremony of AIS&D. Shortly afterward, Su and Lee signed the MOU regarding smart-city development. Su stated that the founding of AIS&D serves as a gateway toward improved quality of life for the citizens of Tainan, as well as increased productivity in its industries. Lee stressed the transformative power of artificial intelligence, adding that the intended smart-city cooperation will likely lead to increased employment opportunities in Tainan.

10,reduced-inequalities,Awakening Taiwan’s Memory of Human Rights through the Sincerity of Art: Memorandum of Understanding between NCKU and the National Human Rights Museum,"National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) and the National Human Rights Museum signed a Memorandum of Understanding for Human Rights Education through Arts in the morning of October 28, 2019 at the NCKU Museum. Because of the signing of this memorandum, the two parties shall co-host the Tainan International Human Rights Festival in November. The programs of the festival include an International Human Rights Art Festival–Symposium on Memory, Human Rights, and Theatre, a theatrical performance from Hong Kong, Lu-ting the Merman, a Taiwanese musical, The Spring of Bayhops, the Phoenix Tree Drama Festival organized by NCKU students, and exhibitions concerning human rights issues in 1960s Taiwan. The dean of the College of Liberal Arts, Chen Yuh-Neu, indicated that human rights issues are closely related to daily life. In addition, the arts affect society in an imperceptible way. Through cooperation with the National Human Rights Museum and the integration of human rights issues with various forms of art such as theater, the visual arts, and performances, NCKU is expected to become the exhibition and research base for human-rights-related artistic creation in southern Taiwan.

After 10 years of preparation, the National Human Rights Museum was established in May 2018. In September of that year, it became the host of the Federation of International Human Rights Museums–Asia Pacific. The museum has thus quickly gained international recognition. The director of the museum, Chen Chun-Hung, stated that human rights issues encompass a wide scope, and the arts serve to establish a platform for conversation, deliberation, and debate. Moreover, the director expressed his hope that Tainan will become a crucial location for human rights exchange and a strong force promoting extraordinary artworks to an international audience under the leadership of NCKU.
The International Human Rights Art Festival–Symposium on Memory, Human Rights, and Theatre—which will be held from November 4 to 6—will be the first international meeting of human rights and theatrical workers in Taiwan. The participants will include theater directors and relevant scholars from Argentina, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Malaysia. Liu Nan-Fang, a associate professor from the Department of Taiwanese Literature, NCKU, has stated that human rights are a universal value, and theater is an excellent artistic medium; in Argentina and South Korea, for example, theaters have been developed to reflect social issues. In addition, on the basis of the theater-related efforts made by NCKU students and faculty members, the International Human Rights Festival can continue to promote human rights education and encourage artistic creation concerning human rights. Through connection of NCKU with the world, Taiwan can participate in the global community with respect to human rights issues.
Professor Kao Mei-Hua, from the Department of Chinese Literature, NCKU, stated that the fight for human rights often results in traumatic memories in a society. Autobiographies, oral history, and documentaries can conserve such history; nevertheless, artistic media such as literature, films, and theaters can turn personal experiences into issues that the society can then contemplate. Professor Kao indicated that we not only preserve sad and painful memories but also interpret and understand history through the medium of art. Furthermore, by participating in the interpretation, creation, and support of human-rights-related art, Taiwanese people’s memories of the human rights movement can be awakened through the sincerity of art.

More importantly, students who conform to the standard of low-income or middle-income households are eligible to apply for fee reduction or free accomodation. Thus, students can be reassured to only focus on their study rather than deal with money.

The rent is normally under 250 pounds per month and it's almost 1/5 of their salary. Thus, it’s quite an affordable price. Moreover, some of the staff would get subsidies on housing. In order to provide a stable living environment for NCKU faculty and staff, and allow teachers to concentrate on teaching and researching work, NCKU provides dormitories for faculty and staff to apply. To offer the affordable dormitory for NCKU faculty and staff, we collect dormitory management fees at a convenient rate.We provide the introduction and the pictures of dormitories on the web page to help our faculty and staff understand the dormitory environment.

In response to the covid-19 pandemic, NCKU soon comes up with a complete emergency scheme, such as requests for students to study from home, adjustment for faculty members to work from home or work off-site. By doing so, it apparently decreases the risk of exposure to the coronavirus from public transportation and people’s contact. More importantly, NCKU has formulated quite a few relevant rules and regulations of working from home like uses of online records for staff’s attendance and communicative softwares. In this way, it’s convenient not only for school but for faculty members to follow the pandemic policy. Meanwhile, information security of NCKU can be protected.In addition, with the establishment of a digital learning platform, students of NCKU and the mass are able to take online courses anywhere (synchronous or asynchronous), and teachers can also carry out online teaching at home or off-site.

NCKU has long been undertaking university social responsibility, and it’s noteworthy that one of its prominent achievements is the promotion of sustainability to the campus, and to the city. In order to support and further carry out the idea of green transportation, NCKU provides CK-Bike, the first university-owned bike sharing system, for students and faculty as an alternative option for commuting. At the current stage, CK-bike service is only available for NCKU digital ID cardholders, but in the future, it will also be open to Non-NCKU members. In addition, NCKU has partnership with Hotai Leasing to provide rideshare u-car service iRent, and with TESLA and Gogoro/e-moving to provide charging stations for electric vehicles. With the implementation of these eco-friendly projects, NCKU’s dedication to the environment for sustainability is obvious for all to see.

廢棄腳踏車認養是成大優良的傳統，每個新學期開始，軍訓都會為學生收集校園內數百無主腳踏車或是廢棄腳踏車，供新生認領，這學期大約有400多輛腳踏車開放讓學生認領，一方面賦予廢棄腳踏車新的生命、嘉惠了成大學生，一方宣導珍惜資源的環保概念。
電機所一年級廖昭銘同學，第一個快手快腳成認領程序，他說今年剛來成大，校園很大真的非常需要一部腳踏車，當他知道成大有這個傳統，特別開心，他認領腳踏車是認品牌，看到捷安特的腳踏車二話不說，扛了就走。
來自法國巴黎的Vigliecca ADem和5個外籍同學在11點就到成大光復校區宿舍後方廣場排隊，他們說來自國外，生活諸多不便，看到學校網站的公告，覺得真是天上掉下來的好禮物，大家相約一起來排隊，並且彼此協助仔細挑選，每個人都要好好找一部牢靠的腳踏車，可以快快樂樂在成大生活。

醫學生理所一年級的謝嘉芸同學也開心的領到一部腳車，她說最主要是上下學的便利性，她聽從前人的經驗指引，找到一部輪胎完整的腳踏車，不用再花錢修理，剎車很好，座椅又不太高，最重要還有一個籃子，可以放書本放水壺，找到腳踏車就可以呼嘯在校園了。

成大軍訓室表示，基於校園景觀及資源再利用的準則，成大每學期都會在校園內進行一次腳踏車回收，包括破舊造成髒亂、違規停車、未張貼識別證或疑似無人的腳踏車，隨後比照警察局失物招領原則，公告半年讓失主認領，最後無人認領的車輛才開放師生認領，此次開放認領數量約有400多輛。

11,sustainable-cities-and-communities,NCKU Signs a Memorandum of Understanding with Tainan Spinning Co. Ltd.: Four Focuses for Sustainable Development,"To fulfill the NCKU 2030 vision for teaching and research, National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) has been integrating resources in the university and actively seeking collaboration opportunities with external partners. NCKU has also been working toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to create a sustainable future and provide a solid foundation for the development of the next generation. On December 1, 2020, the NCKU Department of Urban Planning and Tainan Spinning Co. Ltd., represented by President Su Huey-jen of NCKU and President Wang Li-fan of the company, entered into a memorandum of understanding at NCKU’s C-Hub. Experts from the industrial, governmental, academic, and research sectors were also invited to the signing ceremony, themed “new sustainable environmental development in the postpandemic era,” to discuss how to respond to the postpandemic challenges and work toward sustainable development with four focuses: national territory, urban climate, healthy urban and rural environments, and smart cities.
President Su of NCKU suggested that, in a way, there is this special relationship between each city and university and that the partnership between NCKU and Tainan is the only one in Taiwan that qualifies as a classic role model. She added that a crucial function of universities is to constantly innovate and, through effective and responsible means, translate innovations into practicable measures that create new dynamics in particular fields and boost the potential of the next generation.
President Su mentioned that NCKU’s aim in collaboration with businesses is not to maximize revenues or personal interest but to instead play a critical role in the business partner’s creation of new values, enactment of new changes, and contribution to society, the country, and the world.
President Wang of Tainan Spinning Co. Ltd. expressed that over the 65 years since its establishment, Tainan Spinning has focused mostly on production and manufacturing for its line of business. Tainan spinning owns 250,000 ping (1 ping = 3.306 m2 ) of land in Tainan, among which 130,000 ping of land remains available for future development and planning. Accordingly, collaboration between Tainan Spinning and NCKU is most desirable when the platform between them, which engages the industrial, governmental, academic, and research sectors, is capitalized on to create new job opportunities while aiding local development and to enable businesses to fulfill social responsibilities in their pursuit of profits.
The United Nations proposed 17 SDGs in 2015 to clarify how to create a more sustainable environment and systematically define the innovation and direction of future education. Therefore, hoping to maintain this mindset and develop solutions for sustainable development, NCKU has been actively working toward the NCKU 2030 vision for teaching and research by proposing five Signature Programs of Sustainable Development (SDSPs) : improving the welfare of people; designing an inclusive, sustainable planet; innovating to expedite growth to prosperity; respecting diversity for the promotion of peace; and interdisciplinary development in partnerships.
In the 2020 Times Higher Education Impact Rankings, which assess universities’ social impact in accordance with the SDGs, NCKU was ranked 38th globally. This was the highest ranking in Taiwan and second highest ranking in Asia. Of all the SDGs, NCKU’s performance in 11 was ranked in the top 100 of universities worldwide, and NCKU’s highest ranking, 10th place, was for its performance in the ninth SDG of industry, innovation, and infrastructure. This signifies the world’s recognition of NCKU’s efforts to incorporate SDGs into its major development goals.
T he signing ceremony  was cohosted by scholars from the NCKU College of Planning and Design with an expertise in this field and attended by experts and scholars from the industrial, governmental, academic, and research sectors. With focuses on resilient national territory, urban climate, healthy urban and rural environments, and smart cities, the attendees discussed the postpandemic challenges and how we could move toward and achieve sustainable development.
Chairperson Chao Tzu-yuan of the NCKU Department of Urban Planning suggested that in response to climate change, humans should aim for sustainable development and establish countermeasures for all developments made. She also stressed how great the responsibility is for a university and business to propose such countermeasures. Tainan Spinning, a leading business in Tainan, has been operating for more than 60 years and has been working relentlessly for transformation, diversification, and entry into various supply chains. Tainan Spinning’s aim to diversify its services for the day-to-day convenience of Tainan residents and create business and job opportunities in Taiwan has prompted its industry–academia collaboration with NCKU.

11,sustainable-cities-and-communities,NCKU’s Commitment to Carbon Neutrality,"NCKU’s Commitment to Carbon Neutrality
The National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) acknowledges combating Climate Change has become a collective responsibility for everyone and will promote the importance of combating Climate Change and achieving carbon neutrality through education and multiple channels. It provides state-of-the-art knowledge at an academic level and plays an important role in contributing and enhancing knowledge about Climate Change on local, national, and international levels.
NCKU has committed to the following: 1. By 2024: Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to year 2010 levels. 2. By 2029: Reduce emissions to year 2000 levels. 3. By 2041: Achieve carbon neutrality with the interim goal of reducing NCKU’s carbon footprint by half by 2031, NCKU’s centennial.
NCKU has adopted policies to aggressively reduce greenhouse gases generated as a result of its activities. The NCKU Sustainable Practices Policy reflects and supports Taiwan environmental policy and law with regard to carbon reduction. NCKU has also committed to the ultimate goal of carbon neutrality, a commitment the University formally embraced along with colleges and universities worldwide, when it makes the United Nations SDGs its focus in all its research, teaching, and community outreach and adhere to the THE Impact Ranking criteria.
Climate neutrality means that NCKU will have zero net impact on the earth’s climate. This is achieved by minimizing GHG emissions as much as possible and procuring carbon attributes as necessary to mitigate the remaining emissions.
The Climate Solutions Committee was appointed to advise the President of NCKU on large-scale, systemwide strategies needed to fulfill these commitments. The committee was tasked with exploring planning and decision tools, financial and business models, emerging technologies, and large-scale renewable energy projects that have the potential to move the University’s carbon reduction commitments from concept to implementation.
NCKU’s Climate Goals
The Climate Solutions Committee has focused on the ultimate goal of climate neutrality in developing our recommendations. The rationale for this focus is threefold: It can and must be done. First and foremost is the conviction that climate neutrality can and must be achieved, although the technologies required to do so on the scale required are yet to be fully developed. Achieving the 2031 goal will facilitate climate neutrality soon thereafter.
Second, to achieve the 2031 goal, NCKU needs to develop a climate neutral energy supply on a massive scale.
Third, we recognize the serious reputational consequences of not achieving the goals set forth in NCKU’s climate commitments, including the ultimate goal of climate and carbon neutrality.
Emission Sources
Emissions are categorized as Scope 1 (direct), Scope 2 (indirect), or Scope 3 (other) based on their source. Each source carries with it specific issues and opportunities. Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions from sources controlled by campuses, primarily from combustion of natural gas in co-generation plants. NCKU does not have its own energy infrastructure but will be investing millions of dollars in a new energy infrastructure to generate renewable energy. Its operation will be essential to the University for the foreseeable future, and it is, in fact, a key to one of the recommended climate strategies.
Amongst the menu of possible technologies for generating renewable energy, solar, wind, and possibly co-generation (combined heat and power) plants are the most practical.  Co-generation plants are considered “green” because of the efficiency with which they convert natural gas into electricity and heat and are also carbon-efficient, emitting few units of CO2 per unit of energy produced. Yet they still will account for a certain percent of NCKU’s fixed carbon footprint because they burn natural gas, unless biomethane can substitute for natural gas.
Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions generated during production of electricity and steam that NCKU purchases. They account for a massive percent of NCKU’s emissions.  Unless they are renewable, NCKU’s Scope 2 emission will be substantial.  Taiwan’s government mandate requires utilities to provide 20% of their energy from renewable sources by 2025, which hopefully will reduce NCKU’s Scope 2 emissions. The extent to which Taiwan’s energy grid becomes renewable will determine NCKU’s Scope 2 emissions level.
Scope 3 emissions are other indirect emissions from sources not controlled by the University, primarily commuting and air travel emissions. The University’s Scope 3 emissions constitute a certain percent of the remaining carbon footprint and will also need to be negated to meet NCKU’s commitment to climate neutrality. Encouraging faulty and staff to reduce business travel and students to use bicycles and public transportation will reduce Scope 3 emissions.
Adaptation
Taiwan is located in a monsoon climate zone and stands in the path of typhoons, floods, and landslides. As the pattern of rainfall has become extreme, disasters have become more frequent and more damaging.  Adaptation has become an important issue.
Cross-disciplinary experts at NCKU incorporate SDG13 into their curricula and lead research intending to mitigate the impact of Climate Change.  NCKU also collaborate with domestic and foreign industries, government agencies, and research institutes.  NCKU and its partners connect with the government and the public through developing smart disaster prevention technology, holding academic seminars, handling local government and community education and training, and issuing research publications.

11,sustainable-cities-and-communities,Four Hundred Years of Fort Zeelandia: Recreating Tainan’s History and Value,"National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), which was established in the old capital of Taiwan prefecture during the Qing dynasty, has led Taiwan in research of historical events and archeological excavation. On February 5, 2020, in Anping District, Tainan City, NCKU released the results of its archeological collaboration with the Tainan City Government for the excavation of the former Tayouan City, which was established during Dutch colonization, thus presenting historical evidence in addition to texts. In the future, NCKU will integrate Taiwanese and foreign research and literature on Tainan during Dutch Formosa and conduct cross-regional investigations, explorations, and research to understand the histories and values and to connect the land with the people.

Taiwan is currently an irreplaceable link in the global economy. In fact, Taiwan was already internationalized when Dutch colonists established a trade stronghold in Anping, Tainan 400 years ago and constructed Fort Zeelandia and Tayouan Town. Thus, Taiwan entered the world trade system. Chairman Liu Yi-chang of NCKU’s Institute of Archeology believed that Taiwan’s economic development model centered on foreign trade, with businessmen traveling the world with a single suitcase, has its roots in the Dutch introduction of Taiwan to the world system in 1624. “The Dutch determined Taiwan’s trade character when they chose to establish a trade stronghold in Anping,” he stated, and “Taiwanese people’s love for overseas travel was actually also the result of this trade character.”
In 2018, NCKU began a 6-year research project titled Four Hundred Years of Fort Zeelandia. This project explores Tainan during the Age of Exploration through mutual verification of documents such as the 1643 Fort Zeelandia Cadastral Register, mapping, and excavations. Preliminary investigations based on mapping and surveying results by Assistant Professor Huang En-yu of the Department of Architecture were followed by excavations at Shih-men Elementary School and Sword Lion Square to discover traces of stacking and unearthed relics. NCKU President, Su Huey-jen, and Tainan City Mayor, Huang Wei-che, both attended the presentation of the results.
In 2019, archeological excavations were conducted in the south and east of former Tayouan City, which is now Sword Lion Square and Shih-men Elementary School, to discover urban relics and uncover the previous shoreline position. Institute Chairman Liu stated, “Anping is a major site of historical events, and we look forward to Taiwan restoring part of Fort Zeelandia and Tayouan City so that the public can experience the crucial role that Taiwan played in world trade 400 years ago and understand the formation and development of the current character of Taiwan.”
According to maps of Dutch Taiwan, Shih-men Elementary School is situated on the junction between the land and sea during that time. Therefore, exploratory pits were dug on the south and north sides inside the school campus. On the northern side, excavations uncovered a Qing dynasty brick structure, and further down, a stratum appeared to show a flooding alluvium and aqueous deposits. This phenomenon was similar to the stratigraphic types near the shoreline and may indicate the shoreline position. In the excavation pit at the southern end, although only a small portion of the deposit was preserved, the remnants of canals and building foundations from the Qing dynasty were uncovered.
Sword Lion Square was already a building block during the Dutch colonial period; later, during the Qing dynasty, it was the location of Kinmen Hall, one of five naval halls established by the Qing government. The continuous brick foundations and pavement and the excavated relics—primarily 17th and 18th century porcelain—indicated that the archeological excavations may have been situated on the remains of Kinmen Hall. Due to the upward accumulation of later strata, strata from the Dutch colonial period should also be found in Qing Dynasty strata; therefore, the archeological teams did not dig further.
The abundance of historical materials and documents concerning Dutch Taiwan (such as De Dagregisters van het Kasteel Zeelandia and Dagh-register gegouden int Casteel Batavia) are all written records, and Institute Chairman Liu argued that more information can be found through archeological excavations. During the European Age of Exploration, Japan implemented an isolationist policy and constructed Dejima, an artificial island off the coast of Hirado, Nagasaki, which was the only place Europeans could legally reside. Like Anping, Hirado retains traces of Dutch influence. In recent years, the Japanese government has made efforts to repair Dejima and display the historical sites and relics. This has enabled the Japanese public to experience life on Dejima and become familiarized with the island’s history, as well as to promote understanding of the business activities of the Dutch at that time. This practice is worth mirroring in Taiwan.
The Four Hundred Years of Fort Zeelandia project enters its third year in 2020. In addition to exploring Fort Zeelandia and Tayouan, the project will investigate the relationship and interactions between the Dutch colonists and Taiwanese Aborigines. This will include field excavations in the former sites of the Plains Aborigines tribes Soulang and Mattau, in the current Jiali and Madou districts.
NCKU stated that Four Hundred Years of Fort Zeelandia is an investigative, exploratory research project in Tainan that has assembled interdisciplinary experts and scholars from within and outside Taiwan. Through their joint efforts, this period in history can be presented to the public through various historical, popular, and territorial perspectives. On the 400th anniversary of the establishment of Fort Zeelandia in 2024, the world will be able to consider Taiwan’s history, people, and culture from this time period through exhibitions and activities.

11,sustainable-cities-and-communities,Science communication based on knowledge of coastal environmental changes and fieldwork practice,"Under a combination of scientific research and field practice, a dialogue with users requiring adaptation to the environment, at present there is a gap between scientific knowledge and practical experience. Therefore, the team made good use of knowledge translation, and incorporated the problems identified by the team, accumulated the knowledge and the conflicts faced by the team, into an interactive environmental context with play design. In addition, the team has actively promoted scientific knowledge in the form of stalls, so that valuable research and field experience could be passed on to the public and play a role in shaping civic literacy. Furthermore, based on the concept of disaster prevention education, the team used experiential teaching aids to permit students to link with existing school courses. They were able to evaluate the comprehension and knowledge background of those receiving information, and design a number of teaching aids for impacted learning. Students no longer passively receive information from the instructor and take an examination. Instead, they are actively involved in this interactive classroom for interdisciplinary learning, intergrade and intergenerational knowledge exchanges, and results in a link between science, technology and innovative design and the real world. With a total of 13 subjects involved, including architecture, hydraulic engineering, urban planning, and disaster mitigation technology, students were allowed to think about different environmental issues in an interdisciplinary approach. In response, they said during a course for coastal cleanup activities that ""The conventional beach cleanup program is just to collect and classify garbage. Through the teacher's explanations in the course, however, we have a better understanding of garbage decomposition, the policies and sources of oyster culture floats, as well as a profound experience of the serious impact of human waste on the environment.""
Those experiences and processes are the items that our team has actively developed and promoted. The aim of achieving the goal of the Ministry of Education is to use the university’s social responsibility to change the isolation of traditional education and research, make use of the combination of fields to expand the feasibility of research, and increase the breadth of students' thinking about career development, so they can apply what they have learned for industry-academia cooperation.

11,sustainable-cities-and-communities,First CAR Lab Opens – NCKU’s Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Passes Dynamic Test with Flying Colors,"Connected and autonomous vehicles are being actively developed around the world in hopes of creating vehicles that can instantly make the safest and most appropriate responses to ever-changing road environments and realizing the dream of self-driving cars. In Shalun, Tainan, the Ministry of Science and Technology built the Taiwan CAR (connected, autonomous, road-test) Lab, a closed testing ground and the first of its kind to incorporate the complex traffic environments often seen in the Asia-Pacific region. President Tsai Ing-Wen presided over the opening ceremony on February 25. A dynamic test of a self-driving car developed by NCKU at the ceremony presented perfect performance: stopping at red lights, moving forward at green lights, making turns smoothly, and going around or stopping before obstacles. The results give rise to more imagination and expectations for smart transportation in the future.
The Taiwan CAR Lab has 13 hardware road facilities, such as intersections and pedestrian crossing, and NCKU’s connected autonomous vehicle research team assists in e stablishing various test scenarios that can be integrated with physical tests. NCKU president Dr. Huey-Jen Jenny Su took a ride in the self-driving car developed by NCKU at the opening ceremony. She praised the car for its responses and decision-making and was very satisfied with how smooth the drive was. A number of other ceremony attendees also got to get an early experience of the future world that technology will bring.
The Taiwan Car Lab will initially be managed and operated by the National Applied Research Laboratories (NARL) and the Automotive Research and Testing Center. NCKU president Dr. Huey-Jen Jenny Su and NARL president Yeong-Her Wang signed a collaboration agreement to promote the research and development of verification venues for self-driving vehicles and create a comprehensive traffic detection system.
Dr. Huey-Jen Jenny Su pointed out that NCKU will play a key role in Taiwan’s first connected and automated vehicle testing lab and that their collaboration with NARL will have a synergetic effect which will help them realize society’s AI dreams earlier. The development of new technology will spur progress in new industries and contribute to Taiwan’s smart economy. Yeong-Her Wang stated that connected automated vehicles must undergo stringent testing and will require the integration of NCKU’s technology and energy in electrical engineering, information technology, mechanical engineering, and even management.
NCKU developed the crucial software for connected and automated driving in 2017 and created a prototype that uses technologies such as navigation and positioning, environment sensing, decision-making and planning, and drive control. Communication devices are also installed in the vehicle to provide feedback on vehicle status and enable remote control based on certain procedures when necessary. Autonomous driving can be divided into 5 levels, with level 5 being the highest. At present, NCKU’s autonomous vehicle possesses level 4 autonomous driving capabilities and can drive around campus.
For autonomous vehicles to drive safely on the road, they require the complete integration of technologies in three fields: sensing, decision-making, and control. Complete testing and verification is a necessary process that autonomous vehicles must undergo before they can drive safely on the road and an indispensable part of autonomous vehicle development in Taiwan.

The site is a historical park with a Ching dynasty South gate structure dating back to 1725 and a broadcasting station built by the Japanese in 1932. It has always played an important role in different stages of Tainan. Currently, through my observation, the park is facing a huge contrast from the surroundings. Such as the new and old, tourist and local, urban and neighborhood scale…etc. In order to blend a multi-program architecture into this complex and vibrant environment, I propose to connect all the different programs under one continuous and curved roof structure. This gives a clear definition of what is historical and what is new. The subtle and smooth form would also emphasize the openness of the park.

This project, in line with the national development plan, will promote the concepts of a smart city, green energy, photonics and other high-tech industries. Furthermore, national R&D centers, supplemented by the momentum of an international medical industry, build an ecologically sustainable and circular smart city with the Shalun Farm as an example for future life. Thus combining smart healthcare with biotechnology, and eventually become an economically, socially and ecologically resilient city.
In terms of economic resilience, this project has analyzed the existing local resources in the special district around the Tainan HSR station and its adjacent areas. For example, local animal husbandry businesses industrial clusters, R&D support from the College of Photonics at the Tainan campus of National Chiao Tung University and the Southern Taiwan Science Park, as well as medical resources from the National Cheng Kung University Hospital in East District of Tainan. With the external support of the Ministry of Science and Technology and the government's policies, the team has chosen industries with an increased chance of forming a local complete industrial chain to be the ones introduced into future plans. We aim to strengthen our ability to cope with external economic turbulence with a pluralistic economic structure as the development goal.
Regarding social resilience, this project area is part of the Dawulun community. In addition to meeting the daily needs of a small number of residents in the Tainan HSR special district, it should also pay attention to the needs and demands of the residents of the Dawulun community. The project should anticipate the problems and needs that will arise due to the introduction of new inhabitants and a newly employed population into future industries. In the future, we will strengthen the sense of community and its self-revitalization ability by incorporating community concerns into planning and design.
With respect to ecological and environmental resilience, the project utilized the Shalun Farm as a supporting field and realized the goals of food self-sufficiency, water resources management, energy and waste recycling. In the meantime, we have put forward corresponding countermeasures for natural disasters and ecological conservation, for example typhoons and flood response plans. In addition to rainwater reuse facilities, flood detention or rainwater storage and drainage facilities in general construction, we have also planned rainwater circulation systems and sewage circulation systems to strengthen the capacity of the project area to deal with external natural disasters.

11,sustainable-cities-and-communities,A Green & Smart RideI With CK-Bike,"Not just green, but smart! As part of NCKU Smart Campus, the smart CK-Bike, the first University-owned bike sharing system, is launched on the 1st March, 2018. Chipped and connected, these smart bikes will collect data for future research of campus road safety and the development of future smart transport management system.
NCKU presidentDr. Huey-Jen Jenny Su, Architecture and Building Research Institute, Ministry of the InteriorMr. Shun Chih Wang, Bureau of Transportation, Tainan City Government Mr. Wan Ying Hsiung and Hui Chung Chuang, NCKU The Secretary-General Professor Ching-Chang Lee, and Department of Transportation and Communication Management Science Dr. Chien-hung Wei attended the CK-Bike launch ceremony.
“The CK-Bikes introduces a lifestyle not just green, but also smart. Big Data of CK-Bike project will empower NCKU to construct future smart transportation and smart city. This project also aims to inspire students to create new business models and entrepreneur opportunity“, said president Su.
“With a CK-bike, I can travel easily and fast within the campus.” Said Zhan Dong Ling, a NCKU sophomore (2nd-year student), after his first CK-Bike ride. “With a NCKU digital card, the process for sign-in and pick-up takes less than one minute. It’s useful, friendly and very convenient”, said Huang Xuan Yao, a NCKU junior (3rd year) student.
Five CK-Bike stations will be set up at Medical School, Main Library, Zhong Zheng Memorial Hall, Old Library and Banyan Garden.
The CK-Bike station gate will be empowered by the NCKU digital ID card and the chipped bike upon each entry and exit. This design of “one station one gate” reduces the capital investment of bike station setup, compared to the usual “one bike one gate”. The identity of each user and his/her bike will also be scanned and recorded.
Two types of CK-Bike will be available. 100 customized new bikes and 400 general bikes, including some bikes which were previously dumped in campus. At this stage, CK-Bike will only be available for NCKU digital ID holders. It’s free for the first 60 minutes then NT$ 5 for every 30 minutes. In the future, CK Bike will be available for non-NCKU, credit card users.
Further analysis and research will be conducted with CK-Bike data of cycling routes, use time and frequency, starting point and finish points, etc. Air quality detection will also be a future option. A NCKU student committee will take over the operation management of CK-Bike in April. This will offer an opportunity for students to gain valuable hands-on management experience.
NCKU is a member university of “Sustainablilty Intelligent Community, initiated by the Architecture Research Institute of the Ministry of Interior （MOI）in 2016.
自行車是成大學生主要代步工具，成大在今年 3 月領先各大學創新推出校園自有公共自行車系統CK-Bike，推動節能綠色交通。新學期開始，營運團隊推出全新促銷活動「CK-Bike 鐵腿計畫」，會員只要預付 49 元，自 10 月 1 日起至108 年 1 月 31 日止租借自行車，原本僅第1個小時免費，就能延長為3小時，優惠限量 333 人，即日至 27 日受理申請。另外，除了原有的「一卡通」，「悠遊卡」也已加入CK-Bike系統，成大教職員生的數位證件都能租借，不需再購買私有單車，省錢又環保。
CK-Bike 目的在改善校園內長久存在的自行車閒置及浪費問題，最終目標是學生不需購買私有單車。CK-Bike現由成大學生主導營運與調度維護等事務，服務對象限成大教職員生，暫不開放予校外人士。CK-Bike在校園內共設５個租借站點，分別是光復校區中正堂、勝利校區舊總圖、成功校區圖書館、榕園、醫學院。收費標準第１個小時免費，之後每30分鐘收費5元。49元鐵腿計畫，免費時段由1小時延長為3小時，後續收費維持每30分鐘5元的標準。
營運團隊成員黃玄堯表示，欲辦理 49 元 CK-Bike 鐵腿計畫，需先加入會員http://t.cn/Evlsw7M 完成驗證， CK-Bike粉專有詳細操作流程。之後，再填寫申請表單：https://goo.gl/forms/3dSBK2rduGW1UH2Y2。繳費方式分郵局轉帳700 郵局代號：0031326 0276310，或是9月21日，及 25 日、26、27 日，於學生會辦公室現場繳費，時間為 12:00~14:00 與15:00~ 18:00。
黃玄堯指出，８月底前因只有「一卡通」加入 CK-Bike 系統，再加上成大學生私有自行車比重較高，以及對CK-Bike仍不熟悉等因素，以致CK-Bike借用率仍有不少可加強的空間。但隨著校內師生對CK-Bike日益認識，加上 9 月 4 日起「悠遊卡」加入 CK-Bike 行列，相信營運會越來越好。
借用過的同學，對 CK-Bike 有好評者不在少數，包括變速單車很好騎、方便的代步工具等，提出建議的也有，多數是希望增能增設租借站點，地點以宿舍區佔多數。此外，為了讓租借系統運作更為順暢，暑假期間還特地暫停３週服務加以調整，讓卡卡的狀況逐一改善。CK-Bike 由學生團隊營運，成員共７人，除了交管系學生外，還有資源系、不分系等背景，偶而也會請資工系的同學來協助，經過上學期的摸索調適，營運漸入佳境。（撰文／孟慶慈　攝影／蔡育豪）

11,sustainable-cities-and-communities,Assisting young farmers in the sustainable agriculture action plan against high temperatures in extreme weathers with intelligent irrigation systems,"Asparagus is an agricultural produce containing high nutrients commonly encountered on the dining table. In order to maintain the yield of asparagus, young farmers use a net house to increase the output of asparagus in winter and reduce the losses caused by heavy rain and high winds. Although the yield is increased in winter, the design of the net house in summer results in poor quality of asparagus due to high heat. For this reason, a team headed by professor Tzu-ping Lin of the department of architecture assisted the Banana’s Asparagus farm. This team’s goal is raising the crop’s quality in the net house during summer, and maintaining its output in winter through a novel environmental control technology with an affordable budget.

11,sustainable-cities-and-communities,Application of IoT Technology to Construct a urban high-density environmental quality monitoring network,"A metropolitan area that is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas due to material heat storage, anthropogenic heat, and airflow obstruction is called the urban heat island effect. This not only exerts negative impact on human health and comfort, affecting the quality of urban life, but also increases energy consumption and carbon emissions due to air-conditioning usage in response to rising temperatures. To understand and analyze this important issue of sustainable urban development, the BCLab, led by Professor Tzu-ping Lin of NCKU, teamed up with the Tainan City Government in setting up the High Density Street-level Air-temperature Observations Network (HiSAN). The results of the measurement and analysis of 102 residential temperature measurement points was introduced into the regulatory norms for high-temperature and weak-wind potential areas in urban design deliberations. At the same time, the team also worked with the Kaohsiung City Government to further import IoT technology, establish the smart temperature and environment observation network in Kaohsiung (STONK), and upload real-time environmental information to the cloud, which will benefit Kaohsiung's policy on management of land use, three-dimensional greening and allocation of solar panels.
隨著都市的高密度發展，都市中因為材料蓄熱、人工排熱、氣流受阻的因素，造成都市中心區域較郊區高溫的問題，亦即「都市熱島效應」。它不僅危害人體的舒適健康，降低都市生活品質，同時，室內上昇的溫度將造成建築室內空調耗電量增加，加劇城市能源耗用及碳排放。為了理解及分析這個攸關永續城市發展的重要議題，成功大學林子平教授領導的建築與氣候研究室(BCLab)與台南市政府合作，建立｢高密度地面氣溫量測網｣(High Density Street-level Air-temperature observations Network，HiSAN)，將102個人居層溫度測點的量測分析成果導入都市設計審議中對於高溫及弱風速潛勢區的管制規範。同時，也與高雄市政府合作，進一步導入IoT的技術，建立smart temperature and environment observation network in Kaohsiung, STONK)，將即時的環境資料上傳雲端，有助於高雄厝政策在土地利用、立體綠化、光電版較佳配置之管理應用。

NCKU has formulated a series of regulations on green procurement of school supplies. Specifically, NCKU sticks to the principle of “ethical consumerism”, ensuring the products being sourced are obtained in a responsible and sustainable way. For example, every division in NCKU obeys to purchase products with the label of environmental protection approved by the government, from office supplies, such as file folders, printers, shredders, and projectors, to toilet supplies, such as tissue papers, hand towels, and water-saving toilets.
In addition, with the school policy, “Procurement Priority for the Products and Services of Handicapped Welfare Care Facilities/Institutions and Associations”, NCKU follows the obligated purchase and farms out school projects for increasing the welfare for people in relevant facilities. Lastly, in order to improve the performance of procurement execution, exert economic benefits, and save manpower, NCKU carries out central purchasing  of property and labor in accordance with the school regulations of the implementation of inter-entity supply contracts.
Lastly, NCKU has also been working hard on the provision of hygienic, healthful, and nutritious food ethically obtained from local food suppliers. To ensure the quality of food on campus, a committee has long existed to gatekeep the process through which food products are sourced and obtained in a responsible and sustainable way. The committee consists of leaders of students, faculty members and administrators. Representatives are recommended by each level of the student body and each academic school, including the Department of Food Safety / Hygiene and Risk Management. In addition to food itself, the committee also regularly reviews the environment and well-being of restaurant workers and the religious demands among customers. Semestral meeting minutes are retained online in the public domain for public inspection and monitoring.

12,responsible-consumption-and-production,NCKU’s Commitment to Carbon Neutrality,"NCKU’s Commitment to Carbon Neutrality
The National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) acknowledges combating Climate Change has become a collective responsibility for everyone and will promote the importance of combating Climate Change and achieving carbon neutrality through education and multiple channels. It provides state-of-the-art knowledge at an academic level and plays an important role in contributing and enhancing knowledge about Climate Change on local, national, and international levels.
NCKU has committed to the following: 1. By 2024: Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to year 2010 levels. 2. By 2029: Reduce emissions to year 2000 levels. 3. By 2041: Achieve carbon neutrality with the interim goal of reducing NCKU’s carbon footprint by half by 2031, NCKU’s centennial.
NCKU has adopted policies to aggressively reduce greenhouse gases generated as a result of its activities. The NCKU Sustainable Practices Policy reflects and supports Taiwan environmental policy and law with regard to carbon reduction. NCKU has also committed to the ultimate goal of carbon neutrality, a commitment the University formally embraced along with colleges and universities worldwide, when it makes the United Nations SDGs its focus in all its research, teaching, and community outreach and adhere to the THE Impact Ranking criteria.
Climate neutrality means that NCKU will have zero net impact on the earth’s climate. This is achieved by minimizing GHG emissions as much as possible and procuring carbon attributes as necessary to mitigate the remaining emissions.
The Climate Solutions Committee was appointed to advise the President of NCKU on large-scale, systemwide strategies needed to fulfill these commitments. The committee was tasked with exploring planning and decision tools, financial and business models, emerging technologies, and large-scale renewable energy projects that have the potential to move the University’s carbon reduction commitments from concept to implementation.
NCKU’s Climate Goals
The Climate Solutions Committee has focused on the ultimate goal of climate neutrality in developing our recommendations. The rationale for this focus is threefold: It can and must be done. First and foremost is the conviction that climate neutrality can and must be achieved, although the technologies required to do so on the scale required are yet to be fully developed. Achieving the 2031 goal will facilitate climate neutrality soon thereafter.
Second, to achieve the 2031 goal, NCKU needs to develop a climate neutral energy supply on a massive scale.
Third, we recognize the serious reputational consequences of not achieving the goals set forth in NCKU’s climate commitments, including the ultimate goal of climate and carbon neutrality.
Emission Sources
Emissions are categorized as Scope 1 (direct), Scope 2 (indirect), or Scope 3 (other) based on their source. Each source carries with it specific issues and opportunities. Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions from sources controlled by campuses, primarily from combustion of natural gas in co-generation plants. NCKU does not have its own energy infrastructure but will be investing millions of dollars in a new energy infrastructure to generate renewable energy. Its operation will be essential to the University for the foreseeable future, and it is, in fact, a key to one of the recommended climate strategies.
Amongst the menu of possible technologies for generating renewable energy, solar, wind, and possibly co-generation (combined heat and power) plants are the most practical.  Co-generation plants are considered “green” because of the efficiency with which they convert natural gas into electricity and heat and are also carbon-efficient, emitting few units of CO2 per unit of energy produced. Yet they still will account for a certain percent of NCKU’s fixed carbon footprint because they burn natural gas, unless biomethane can substitute for natural gas.
Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions generated during production of electricity and steam that NCKU purchases. They account for a massive percent of NCKU’s emissions.  Unless they are renewable, NCKU’s Scope 2 emission will be substantial.  Taiwan’s government mandate requires utilities to provide 20% of their energy from renewable sources by 2025, which hopefully will reduce NCKU’s Scope 2 emissions. The extent to which Taiwan’s energy grid becomes renewable will determine NCKU’s Scope 2 emissions level.
Scope 3 emissions are other indirect emissions from sources not controlled by the University, primarily commuting and air travel emissions. The University’s Scope 3 emissions constitute a certain percent of the remaining carbon footprint and will also need to be negated to meet NCKU’s commitment to climate neutrality. Encouraging faulty and staff to reduce business travel and students to use bicycles and public transportation will reduce Scope 3 emissions.
Adaptation
Taiwan is located in a monsoon climate zone and stands in the path of typhoons, floods, and landslides. As the pattern of rainfall has become extreme, disasters have become more frequent and more damaging.  Adaptation has become an important issue.
Cross-disciplinary experts at NCKU incorporate SDG13 into their curricula and lead research intending to mitigate the impact of Climate Change.  NCKU also collaborate with domestic and foreign industries, government agencies, and research institutes.  NCKU and its partners connect with the government and the public through developing smart disaster prevention technology, holding academic seminars, handling local government and community education and training, and issuing research publications.

12,responsible-consumption-and-production,National Cheng Kung University iGEM Team wins the 2019 iGEM Competition Grand Prize with the Highest Scores in Taiwan’s Participation History,"An interdisciplinary team from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) participated in the 2019 International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) in Boston, USA. The team, called iGEM NCKU Tainan, entered a team project named Oh My Gut, which was based on chronic kidney disease. Surpassing 346 international contenders, the iGEM NCKU Tainan team won the undergraduate team Grand Prize. The team demonstrated the most outstanding performance among all iGEM teams from Taiwan during the preceding decade. NCKU President Huey-Jen Su stated excitedly, “watched by nearly tens of thousands of spectators and with international broadcast, we proved that we have the top research abilities that constitute a winning team.” After celebrating their victory, members of the iGEM NCKU Tainan team expressed gratitude to NCKU for being the “greatest support for student research.”

In addition to winning the Grand Prize, the Oh My Gut project was nominated for 10 awards and won 5 of them, namely the Best Therapeutics Project, Best Presentation, Best Hardware, Best Model, and Best Measurement awards.
Professor I-Hsiu Huang of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, who served as an advisor to the team, noted that previous student teams mainly selected environment-based project themes, but the student team of 2019 selected a treatment-based project. Thus, in addition to designing and creating instrument models, they were required to consider user safety and convenience. Therefore, the project required a meticulous consideration and exhibited a considerably higher difficulty level than previous projects did. Furthermore, English presentation abilities are crucial for large-scale international competitions. The iGEM NCKU Tainan team emphasized this aspect and won the Best Presentation award, a particular achievement for a team from a country where English is not the native language. In summary, the outstanding performance of the 2019 NCKU iGEM team was the result of the accumulated experiences of previous NCKU iGEM teams. In addition, members of the two previous NCKU iGEM teams provided support to the 2019 team; they even passed on advice about how to pass the microphone between speakers.
Sabrina Yeo Samuel, a third-year student of the Department of Biotechnology and Bioindustry Sciences revealed that the project took up most of the members’ extracurricular time. During July and August, the team endeavored to make preparations for the competition. Although team members envied their peers enjoying the summer, the team agreed that they should thoroughly prepare for the competition, because opportunities to participate in large-scale international competitions are rare. Despite the tiring preparation process, the outcomes of their preparation were abundant. Team members learned how to effectively conduct time management, honed their abilities to communicate and coordinate, and learned experimental techniques. These outcomes will support the team members in their future careers.
iGEM is a world-class synthetic biology and genetic engineering competition. By combining synthetic biology and genetic engineering with professional knowledge in electrical engineering, information management, medical, engineering, and physics fields, the competition aims to encourage the development of applications to resolve crucial issues. The 2019 iGEM competition was divided into 11 categories; participating teams included 47 high school teams, almost 200 undergraduate teams, and almost 100 post-graduate teams. From October 29, 2019, to November 8, 2019, the NCKU iGEM team participated in the 15th iGEM in Boston, USA. The team adopted a theme titled Oh My Gut and aimed to provide a novel treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease to resolve the issue of uremic toxin accumulation.
The NCKU iGEM team has won the Grand Prize each year since its first participation 3 years ago, thereby leading the promotion of interdisciplinary self-learning in higher education. Students from the team established the NCKU synthetic biology research club and recruited interdisciplinary members. In 2019, the club had 14 members from the College of Medicine, College of Engineering, and College of Bioscience and Biotechnology. Professors advising the club included Professor I-Son Ng of the Department of Chemical Engineering, Associate Professor I-Hsiu Huang of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Assistant Professor Masayuki Hashimoto of the Institute of Molecular Medicine, and Han-Ching Wang of the Department of Biotechnology and Bioindustry Sciences. Under their guidance, the club students selected research themes, challenged their fields of interest, transcended environment-related themes, and aimed to make a breakthrough in the medical field. The research results achieved outstanding outcomes in the iGEM competition; this was a successful example of the self-learning flipped classroom model.
In 2019, the NCKU iGEM team employed the concept of escape rooms and adopted novel methods to present their research findings. By creating Cresolve through synthetic biology, a patient’s p-Cresol level due to uremic toxin accumulation can be reduced. In addition, CreSense hardware was adopted to separate the serum and plasma, the fluorescence intensity emitted by green fluorescent proteins was used to analyze the proteins’ chemical residues. This enabled measurement of the blood concentration of p-Cresol. The team aimed to use this overall process, which was named CreSolution, to improve the quality of life of patients with chronic kidney disease.
The NCKU iGEM team indicated that each team member contributed considerable efforts throughout the 9 months of winter vacation training, intramural preliminary presentation of the selected theme, confirmation of the theme and further research, work on the project during summer vacation, intramural final presentation of the research results, and entry to the competition. The team stated, “we would like to thank everyone who helped the NCKU iGEM team. In particular, we would like to thank NCKU and Diamond Biofund Inc. for providing considerable resources and support. We believe that in the future, NCKU will continue to serve as the biggest supporter of student research.”
The iGEM competition was established by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2003; it is participated in by student teams from countries worldwide who are passionate about biology. In the competition, student teams compete in the use of experimental design and genetic engineering to solve real-world problems. Therefore, the iGEM is an interdisciplinary competition that encompasses biology, medicine, energy, information engineering, and social participation. The objective of the competition is to “facilitate the research and collaboration of interdisciplinary fields and employ engineering techniques to create standardized Bio-Bricks, which are used to construct microorganism genomes with a variety of practical values in order to solve social issues.” The iGEM competition is frequently reported in internationally recognized science magazines, such as Nature, and receives participants from more than 30 countries.

12,responsible-consumption-and-production,"Environmental Protection on Campus: Department of Architecture, National Cheng Kung University Becomes the First to Ban Styrofoam for Model Construction","#YEAR2020
To promote waste reduction, the Department of Architecture, National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) has banned students from using Styrofoam to construct models since the first semester of the 2019 academic year. This was a concrete response to environmental issues and an implementation of environmentally friendly policies in the classroom. The chair of the Department of Architecture, professor Kwang-Tyng Wu, stated that this was the first such initiative by an architecture department in Taiwan. The recycling of Styrofoam consumes considerable manpower and material resources; thus, reliance on Styrofoam should be curbed to avoid excessive waste of resources.
Styrofoam, which is made by adding a blowing agent to polystyrene and heating it, is a relatively light and cheap material that is thin, widely available, and easy to manipulate, and it is often used as a modeling material by architecture students. In the first week of the 2019 academic year, the Department of Architecture, NCKU announced to the students of all grades through design class professors that the use of Styrofoam has been banned. Professors and students agreed to the new policy, and the department’s studio is currently providing environmentally friendly alternative materials such as corrugated paper and wooden boards for model construction. Wu stated that, “Our space has become clearer now that there are no more Styrofoam dust. The abolishment of Styrofoam has been unexpectedly successful.”
Wu believed that the student participation is highly related to the successful banning of Styrofoam. In 2019, students of the Department of Architecture discovered that the department often had considerable leftover model materials waiting to be processed; thus, they established a Flea Market club for students of all grades that served as an exchange platform for leftover materials. According to Wu, the Flea Market has effectively increased the utilization rate of materials, reduced resource waste, and helped students save material expenses. This was a concrete action that followed the public welfare and environmental protection goals of recycling.
The founder of the Flea Market, Chung-Hsien Hung, expressed disappointment with the considerable amount of leftover model materials in the department during 2018. Because she wanted to practice lessons about the recycling economy, she modified the rebar that was originally used as part of the department building’s structure and was currently exhibited in the department’s exhibition space into storage shelves. Many of the existing materials were left by previous students, and the entire space exemplified a concept of recycling.
The Flea Market stores a variety of tools and materials for model making. For example, there are various colors and volumes of spray paint, various textures and sizes of paper, different lengths of wood scraps, cork boards, and drawing rulers. The Flea Market also introduced a unique way of purchasing. Chia-Hsuan Wu, a senior in the Department of Architecture and the current administrator of the Flea Market said that “when you are shopping in the Flea Market, you first buy shopping baskets of various sizes ranging from NT$10 to NT$80. You are then free to take anything as long as it can fit in the basket.”
The bargain price has encouraged many students to search for items at the Flea Market. Ya-Yu Hsiao, a sophomore in the Department of Architecture and another administrator of the Flea Market, said that for students, the Flea Market can reduce the cost of model materials and can fulfil the objectives of environmental protection and waste reduction; Hsiao noted that “it is really great to have a space like this in the department.”

為推動垃圾減量，成大建築系自108學年度第一學期開始禁止學生使用保麗龍材料製作模型，以具體行動回應環保議題，友善環境從課堂開始做起。成大建築系主任吳光庭表示，這是全台建築類科系的首創行動，保麗龍回收耗費龐大的人力與物力，應拒絕對保麗龍無意識的依賴，避免造成資源過度浪費。
保麗龍是由聚苯乙烯（Polystyrene , PS）加入發泡劑，加熱所製成的一種較輕的材質，具有輕薄、價格便宜、好取得且易於裁切等特性，是過去建築系學生經常選用的模型素材。成大建築系自108學年度開學第一週起，透過各年級設計課的老師向學生宣導禁用保麗龍，師生們紛表贊同，目前系上工作室已開始使用其他替代材料例如瓦楞紙、木板等各類環保素材製作模型，吳光庭笑言，「現在不見保麗龍飛屑，空間變得清爽多了，沒想到廢止使用保麗龍的推動意外成功」。
此次廢止使用保麗龍活動能順利推展，吳光庭認為跟學生有很大的關係。去年建築系學生發現系館常有大量模型餘料待處理，自主成立跨年級社團「蚤市」作為回收再利用的材料交易所。吳光庭表示，「蚤市」有效提升材料使用率減少資源浪費，也可幫學生節省材料開支，是符合公益及環保「循環使用」的具體行動，一舉數得。
蚤市創辦人洪仲萱說，去年觀察到系上有很多模型餘料覺得很可惜，想將「循環經濟」課程所學落地實踐，利用系館原鋼筋建材展示空間，就地取材將鋼筋結構改造為收納層架，現存模型餘料很多都是學長姐留下來的，整個空間都是回收再利用的概念。
「蚤市」存有各式各樣做模型時會使用的工具與材料，舉凡各色每瓶容量不一的噴漆、各種材質大小尺寸不定的紙類、長短不齊的木材角料、軟木板、繪圖尺規等，消費方式也很特別；現任管理員建築系大四吳家萱介紹，「進來蚤市購物，先購買10元到80元不等的不同大小的購物籃，只要容器裝得進去的都可以帶走。」
平易近人的價格希望吸引許多學生前來尋寶。同為蚤市管理員之一的建築系大二蕭雅聿分析，蚤市對學生而言，可減輕模型材料開銷，同時還能兼做環保杜絕浪費，「系上有這個空間真的很棒」。

12,responsible-consumption-and-production,Paper Wastes Become Innovative Architectural Material,"This project was started by Chung Hwa Pulp Corporation from a model of corporate social responsibility and is supported by C-Hub. As a center of resource integration, C-hub creates a platform to connect universities and industries. With the help of the architecture team LiLinLab, the professors and students from courses in the forward-thinking M. Arch II program of the Institute of Architecture at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) partnered with the business world to conduct research. In brief, this project not only strove to bridge the gap between universities and industries but also to bring people from different colleges and departments together to face real problems from the business world. There were five CE TALKs to help the graduate students understand more about circular economics.
First, Shadow Chen, the vice-CEO of the Taiwan Circular Economy Network, delivered a lecture about the basics of circular economics and its global trends. Secondly, Bart van Bueren, the director of the Taiwan Dutch Design Post, shared several examples of circular economy in the Netherlands. Pi Cheng Chen, an assistant professor in NCKU’s Department of Environmental Engineering, gave an introduction to environmental resources, while Yang Jia Han, an assistant professor in NCKU’s Institute of Creative Industries Design, illustrated business models. Finally, CEO Wen Yih Kuo from LOTOS analyzed the current development of Taiwan’s industries and shared his own experiences with circular economic ventures.In addition to studying the above theories, the students also participated in four workshops to put circular economy into practice. To begin with, a QIZHI team held brick-making workshops. Students learned to design the shape of the bricks, mix papermaking by- products and wastewater with concrete, and make molds.

13,climate-action,NCKU’s Commitment to Carbon Neutrality,"NCKU’s Commitment to Carbon Neutrality
The National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) acknowledges combating Climate Change has become a collective responsibility for everyone and will promote the importance of combating Climate Change and achieving carbon neutrality through education and multiple channels. It provides state-of-the-art knowledge at an academic level and plays an important role in contributing and enhancing knowledge about Climate Change on local, national, and international levels.
NCKU has committed to the following: 1. By 2024: Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to year 2010 levels. 2. By 2029: Reduce emissions to year 2000 levels. 3. By 2041: Achieve carbon neutrality with the interim goal of reducing NCKU’s carbon footprint by half by 2031, NCKU’s centennial.
NCKU has adopted policies to aggressively reduce greenhouse gases generated as a result of its activities. The NCKU Sustainable Practices Policy reflects and supports Taiwan environmental policy and law with regard to carbon reduction. NCKU has also committed to the ultimate goal of carbon neutrality, a commitment the University formally embraced along with colleges and universities worldwide, when it makes the United Nations SDGs its focus in all its research, teaching, and community outreach and adhere to the THE Impact Ranking criteria.
Climate neutrality means that NCKU will have zero net impact on the earth’s climate. This is achieved by minimizing GHG emissions as much as possible and procuring carbon attributes as necessary to mitigate the remaining emissions.
The Climate Solutions Committee was appointed to advise the President of NCKU on large-scale, systemwide strategies needed to fulfill these commitments. The committee was tasked with exploring planning and decision tools, financial and business models, emerging technologies, and large-scale renewable energy projects that have the potential to move the University’s carbon reduction commitments from concept to implementation.
NCKU’s Climate Goals
The Climate Solutions Committee has focused on the ultimate goal of climate neutrality in developing our recommendations. The rationale for this focus is threefold: It can and must be done. First and foremost is the conviction that climate neutrality can and must be achieved, although the technologies required to do so on the scale required are yet to be fully developed. Achieving the 2031 goal will facilitate climate neutrality soon thereafter.
Second, to achieve the 2031 goal, NCKU needs to develop a climate neutral energy supply on a massive scale.
Third, we recognize the serious reputational consequences of not achieving the goals set forth in NCKU’s climate commitments, including the ultimate goal of climate and carbon neutrality.
Emission Sources
Emissions are categorized as Scope 1 (direct), Scope 2 (indirect), or Scope 3 (other) based on their source. Each source carries with it specific issues and opportunities. Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions from sources controlled by campuses, primarily from combustion of natural gas in co-generation plants. NCKU does not have its own energy infrastructure but will be investing millions of dollars in a new energy infrastructure to generate renewable energy. Its operation will be essential to the University for the foreseeable future, and it is, in fact, a key to one of the recommended climate strategies.
Amongst the menu of possible technologies for generating renewable energy, solar, wind, and possibly co-generation (combined heat and power) plants are the most practical.  Co-generation plants are considered “green” because of the efficiency with which they convert natural gas into electricity and heat and are also carbon-efficient, emitting few units of CO2 per unit of energy produced. Yet they still will account for a certain percent of NCKU’s fixed carbon footprint because they burn natural gas, unless biomethane can substitute for natural gas.
Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions generated during production of electricity and steam that NCKU purchases. They account for a massive percent of NCKU’s emissions.  Unless they are renewable, NCKU’s Scope 2 emission will be substantial.  Taiwan’s government mandate requires utilities to provide 20% of their energy from renewable sources by 2025, which hopefully will reduce NCKU’s Scope 2 emissions. The extent to which Taiwan’s energy grid becomes renewable will determine NCKU’s Scope 2 emissions level.
Scope 3 emissions are other indirect emissions from sources not controlled by the University, primarily commuting and air travel emissions. The University’s Scope 3 emissions constitute a certain percent of the remaining carbon footprint and will also need to be negated to meet NCKU’s commitment to climate neutrality. Encouraging faulty and staff to reduce business travel and students to use bicycles and public transportation will reduce Scope 3 emissions.
Adaptation
Taiwan is located in a monsoon climate zone and stands in the path of typhoons, floods, and landslides. As the pattern of rainfall has become extreme, disasters have become more frequent and more damaging.  Adaptation has become an important issue.
Cross-disciplinary experts at NCKU incorporate SDG13 into their curricula and lead research intending to mitigate the impact of Climate Change.  NCKU also collaborate with domestic and foreign industries, government agencies, and research institutes.  NCKU and its partners connect with the government and the public through developing smart disaster prevention technology, holding academic seminars, handling local government and community education and training, and issuing research publications.

13,climate-action,Adaptation Strategies for Large-Scale Landslides and Dammed Lake Disasters,"Climate Change has increased severe rainfalls and the probability of the large-scale landslides in catchment areas. Thus, rolling adjustments are needed to update the current disaster prevention strategies. In particular, compound earth and sand disasters, which may be caused by large-scale collapses, will pose serious danger to the safety of life and damage property. Therefore, the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau has proposed a large-scale Climate Change collapse prevention and mitigation plan, with the main objectives of; strengthening the large-scale collapse crisis response capabilities, building smart disaster prevention systems in large-scale earth and sand disaster areas, assessing effectiveness of harnessing earth and sand disasters in large-scale earth and sand disaster areas, resource conservation surveys in large-scale earth and sand disaster areas, water and soil conservation management in large-scale earth and sand disaster areas, and disaster prevention information promotion and exchange in large-scale earth and sand disaster areas. Over the years, the NCKU Disaster Prevention Research Center has assisted in; the development of large-scale collapse demarcation methods, the mapping of large-scale collapse zones and the check on Disaster Prevention/Relief resources , assessment of vulnerabilities and risk management, the establishment of large-scale collapse monitoring systems, developing methods for estimating rainfall in a large-scale collapse, and establishing a response management value for issuing a large-scale early warning. The NCKU Disaster Prevention Research Center uses annual international seminars and expert advisory committees to invite experts on large-scale collapse prevention and control technologies from home and abroad to collaborate, and is committed to improving the technical ability for reducing large-scale collapses and disasters in Taiwan. In addition, the NCKU Disaster Prevention Research Center develops contingency management policies and standard procedures for response to landslide-dammed lakes, carries out education and training to strengthen resilience, collects and organizes landslide-dammed lake disaster contingency cases, and provides professional consultation and cooperation in the event of disasters.

13,climate-action,Community Empowerment for Autonomous Flood Prevention,"In recent years, the rainfall pattern in Taiwan has been affected by Climate Change and causing it to become extremely abnormal and unpredictable. The high-intensity and long-lasting rainfall makes the scale, scope and impact of flooding larger than before. Although various engineering measures have mitigating effects, it is difficult to predict the scale and location of the disaster, which highlights the indispensable importance of non-engineering measures for example early warning, notification and response. With the aim of integrating the abilities of the central and local governments, starting in 2012 the NCKU Disaster Prevention Research Center assisted the Tainan City Government in establishing and maintaining autonomous flood disaster prevention communities (based on villages). As of 2018, 35 autonomous disaster prevention communities have been established.
Prior to a disaster, the general public's awareness of disaster prevention and response is improved and disaster prevention through education and training, disaster prevention drills, research and development of community evacuation plans and disaster prevention maps, and provision of community disaster prevention and response equipment. Community weather warning information is provided during the disaster, and both the disaster and evacuation status is tracked, confirmed, and sent to the central and local governments. After the disaster, the situation will be monitored and investigated, and feedback will be rendered to revise and improve the community disaster prevention plan.
From the three phases of pre-disaster preparedness, disaster response and post-disaster recovery, the communities will be assisted by comprehensive counseling. An integrated platform will be developed for disaster prevention in communities and enables autonomous flood disaster prevention to become the core of the flood disaster response mechanism. The concept of self-help and mutual assistance will be established within and between communities, so that the resilience of the communities will be continuously enhanced to reduce the impact of flood disasters.

13,climate-action,Flood and Drought Adaptation Technologies as National Development Strategies,"Floods and droughts are the major natural disasters in Taiwan. Under the influence of Climate Change, rainfall patterns are becoming more unpredictable, and the impact of floods and droughts is getting worse. In order to solve the water shortage and flooding problems, the Water Resources Agency has proposed three major policy objectives of mitigating impacts, improving adaptation and ""zero-sacrifice evacuation to respond to Climate Change. The NCKU Disaster Prevention Research Center assisted the Water Resources Agency in reorganizing the Disaster Prevention/Relief System. This collaboration updated implementation results, and proposed flood and drought adaptation technologies as national development strategies. The four major development axes are; observation and forecasting systems, disaster risk analysis and value-added applications, information transfer and exchange systems, and disaster response capabilities. The development strategies include; expansion of information sources on flood disasters, improvement of hydrological observation and forecasting techniques, integration of disaster prevention resources, and improvement of contingency plans, strengthening of pipelines for flood disaster information transmission, coordination of specific agencies for floods and droughts prevention and rescues, and participation of the public for flood rescues.
The NCKU Disaster Prevention Research Center actively participates in major planning  for various axes, develops flood warning systems and integrated disaster prevention information systems at county and city levels, monitors hydrological and territorial environmental changes, analyzes disaster hotspots for risk stratification, provides immediate warning information and decisions for reference during crises, handles education and training to improve the disaster prevention response of relevant business personnel, and strengthen the resilience of the local communities.

13,climate-action,NCKU President’s Contribution to Indoor Air Quality on Healthy Buildings,"In Healthy Buildings 2017 Asia, a conference on indoor air quality issues, President of National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) as well as the Conference President, Huey-Jen Jenny Su, ScD gave her 40-minute invited speech - Towards a Healthier and More Just Indoor Air Quality: Past, Current and Future Challenges in Taiwan, in which she discussed the causes and impacts of poor indoor air quality (IAQ) on human beings, especially some vulnerable groups.
In view of the environmental risks, many countries, such as U.S, Canada, Germany, and Australia, have already developed their IAQ management programs. Taiwan is among one of them that had progressed from the announcement of IAQ Guideline in 2005 to the enactment of IAQ Management Act in 2012.
Taiwan's IAQ Investigation had sampled 2779 sites from 1998 to 2016 in various public indoor settings. In spite of the research effort and law enforcement, environmental air problems remain serious. The attainment rates of indoor air pollutants, such as CO2, CO, O3, PM 2.5 and PM10 continue increasing.
The significant impact of global climate changes on IAQ has violated human health both physically and mentally through the ways of extreme heat, outdoor air quality, flooding, and infections.
Regarding future actions and challenges, President Su ended with 3 key points. First, human beings should take mitigation measures, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to improve our health and minimize the climate change.
Second, there's a strong need of further research to find the optimal approaches for potential mitigation measures and adaption in buildings, construction technologies and urbanism.
Finally, manage the indoor pollutants that lead to the health risk for vulnerable groups of people, such as children, the elderly, chronic patients, occupants in high-risk buildings and those waiting to be discovered.
「研究證明，城市的空氣常比室內空氣污染嚴重，對健康帶來更大的影響；氣候變遷，建築可以降低氣候對人的直接影響，室內空氣品質對健康的重要性，無庸置疑！如何減少氣候變遷帶來空氣品質等衝擊，需要科學界更多的關注與研究」。
2017年「亞洲健康建築國際研討會」進入第四天，國立成功大學校長暨成大工業衛生學科暨環境醫學研究所教授蘇慧貞獲邀擔任壓軸講師，發表「TOWARDS A HEALTHIER AND MORE JUST INDOOR AIR QUALITY: Past, Current and Future Challenges in Taiwan」專題演講。
蘇慧貞教授以大量的研究資料，說明大眾生活型態改變，對室內空氣品質帶來的影響，各國室內空氣品質的法規、標準與管制以及台灣相關法規的發展歷程，以及現在的規範。台灣環保署於2012年正式推動室內空氣品質管理辦法，是世界第二個通過這類立法的國家，法規執行後，台灣公共建築環境空氣品質顯著提高。
氣候變遷，帶來許多衝擊，建築可以降低氣候對人的直接影響，現在許多國家設法以綠建築、智慧建築等來因應，但對開發中的國家來說成本太高，只能考慮以最經濟、簡單的方式來因應，如透過行為的改變，如開窗增加通風或使用電扇。
蘇慧貞教授認為，日積月累導致的氣候變遷、空氣品質惡化等問題，開發中國家並非元凶，遭受的衝擊卻很大，也沒有太多因應與改變的能力，如何降低開發中國家的衝擊，提升因應能力，科學界要多加重視。
2017年第一屆「亞洲健康建築國際研討會」，9月2日至9月5日於成功大學醫學院第三講堂舉行，會議由國際空氣品質及氣候學會與台灣室內環境品質學會、國立成功大學共同舉辦。大會突破以往地區性或單一國家的思維，以期建構跨國界合作，提升氣候適應性暨增進永續發展，共創更良好的健康建築及室內空氣品質。
為期4天的「亞洲健康建築國際研討會」，有來自日本、美國、丹麥、芬蘭、新加坡、韓國等18個國家室內空氣品質、建築環境、空調系統、健康科學等領域的研究人員、專業人士逾250人與會；另有2場工作坊及1場台韓論壇，提供與會人士討論和學習新領域平台。

13,climate-action,Microalgae Carbon Reduction Technology,"Taiwan has introduced legislation to reduce carbon emissions 50% by 2050 as a result of research institutes being more active in developing novel technologies. Microalgae are the most efficient carbon dioxide sequesters on earth and utilize photosynthesis. Due to their fast growth rate, minimal land area requirements, and can be cultured in seawater, various countries have put forth a significant amount of effort to develop carbon sequestration technologies for microalgae. Led by Professor Jo-Shu Chang (Department of Chemical Engineering), the largest microalgae cultivation demonstration facility uses waste gas from a factory and wastewater from fish farms to cultivate the microalgae and to develop microalgae carbon reduction technology. 1kg of microalgae can consume 2kg of carbon dioxide, thus constituting a novel weapon though which Taiwan can enter the era of carbon reduction. After carbon sequestration, this method transforms the microalgae into health food and animal feed nutrition additives, with high economic value, thus converting waste gas into gold.

13,climate-action,Compound Earth and Sand Disaster Adaptation – Forward-Looking Vision,"In recent years, due to earthquakes and extreme rainfalls, the frequency and scale of large-scale earth and sand disasters have increased year by year. Under the influence of Climate Change, the problem of earth and sand control has been transformed from a local single-spot disaster, for example a single-spot collapse or debris flow, into a complex and wide area earth-soil problem in the catchment region. The NCKU Disaster Prevention Research Center, a unit of the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, develops the Compound Earth and Sand Disaster Adaptation Plan for Taiwan. In the future, these entities will check relevant research and policy implementation results and objectives at home and abroad, convene expert consultation meetings, handle earth-sand forums, and publish special literature on earth-sand control. The NCKU Disaster Prevention Research Center uses Harmonious Forest and Smart Disaster Prevention as two forward-looking visions to achieve goals of balance, harmony, intelligence, accuracy and autonomy.
The 8+1 Grand Strategies include; slope management and collaboration; national geosphere information construction and integration; full-scale geosphere monitoring via the Internet of Things; integration, research and development of the geosphere alert technology; construction and development of geosphere decision-making smart cloud; development of innovative conservation technology; management of slope disaster prevention and life-sustaining channels; sustainable use and management of the land; and promotion of grassroots disaster prevention forces. These principles will guide the NCKU Disaster Prevention Research Center and proposes that consumption and growth of soil sand can be balanced; a stable watershed system can be constructed; a harmonious slope environment can be constructed to build the disaster prevention ecology; innovative monitoring technologies can be used to construct a smart information platform; integrate predictive models can be constructed to build an accurate vigilance system; and disaster prevention education can be popularized to construct sustainable disaster prevention communities and strengthen the resilience of the land.

13,climate-action,Research on Innovative Technologies for Landslide Disaster Prevention under Extreme Environmental Conditions,"Climate Change has become the new norm, and the impact it brings will become more frequent and intense.
According to a study published at the 2016 Conference of the European Geosciences Union, from 1900 to 2015, natural disasters had killed 8 million people, resulting in losses of up to 7 trillion US dollars. There is a clear trend of increasing severity over time, of which more than half of the casualties and losses were indirectly caused by natural disasters.  Analyzing the history of Taiwan's major disasters, NCKU has played a leading role in academic research for disasters in the middle and southern regions where Typhoon Morakot hit in 2009, the serious casualties in Tainan City, and the burial of residents in the debris flow of the Yanchao mudstone area in the south. NCKU counselled the research teams in the school to study the occurrence of various natural disasters, and proposed constructive measures for prevention, management and remedy.
Among the research teams in the school, the NCKU Smart Geotechnical Lab led by Dr. Hong Jing has been working to improve the scientific cognition of disasters due to Climate Change; measurement and analysis technologies, acceptance of science and technology, and linking with the world. Supported by the Young scholars' development plan sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology in 2008, the team discussed key disaster prevention issues: 1) unravel landslide failure mechanisms and precisely define the time of failure; 2) define the particularity of mudstone slope failure and reproduce its failure process; 3) pioneer the development of new engineering technologies in response to extreme environmental conditions; 4) assist government agencies in promoting the application of disaster prevention practices; and 5) export research results and application experience to foster international connections. Although the NCKU Smart Geotechnical Team is in the early stage of academic development, this team possesses great potential. It encourages the next generation of scholars and students in the NCKU to be more active and work hard to earn a good reputation for NCKU as an internationally renowned institution.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that the research results of the first master student instructed by the NCKU Smart Geotechnical Team was honored by being awarded the 2016 Master's Thesis Award from the Taiwan Geotechnical Engineering Society. Three SCI grade papers have been published as a result. This team will construct the dynamic geophysical exploration technology in the near future and properly apply its technology to improve responses to disasters caused by Climate Change in Taiwan.
This team will use Taiwan's disaster prevention as a base to overcome Climate Change with forward-looking research topics and pioneer the world's academic research in related fields to enhance NCKU’s international competitiveness.
氣候變遷已為新常態，其所帶來之衝擊可能變得更頻繁與劇烈。根據2016歐洲地球科學聯盟會議發表的研究報告指出，自1900-2015年以來，自然災害已導致800萬人喪生，造成損失達7兆美元，並有逐年增高的明顯趨勢，其中，亦有大半的傷亡與損失為自然災害伴隨而間接導致之。回顧臺灣過去重大災害歷史，從2009年莫拉克風災重創中南部地區，到2016美濃地震造成臺南市嚴重的傷亡以及南部燕巢泥岩地區土石流掩埋居民等悲劇，NCKU均發揮其學術研究領頭羊的角色，用心輔導校內研究團隊鑽研各種自然災害發生，不懈於提出具建設性的預防、管理、補救對策。其中，本校由洪瀞老師所帶領的NCKU智慧地工實驗室，一直致力於提升對抗氣候變遷引致之災害的科學認知、測量與解析技術、科普推廣、以及與世界的鏈結。其團隊獲科技部107年度年輕學者養成計畫支持，針對以下關鍵防減災議題進行探討：1) 解開山崩破壞機制，精確定義破壞初始時間； 2) 定義泥岩邊坡破壞之特殊性與重現其破壞過程；3) 首創與發展因應極端環境之新創工程實驗技術；4) 協助政府部門推動於災防實務之應用；5) 輸出研究成果與應用經驗以擴大國際鏈結。儘管NCKU智慧地工團隊屬初期的學術發展階段，此團隊將不會因此而限縮眼界，期鼓勵我校次世代的學者與學生們更積極進取為NCKU的國際知名招牌爭取貢獻。最後值得一提的是，NCKU智慧地工團隊首位指導的碩士生之研究成果即有榮幸獲臺灣大地工程學會2016年碩士論文獎，相關成果亦已刊載3篇SCI等級論文。此團隊期在不遠的未來建構動態地球物理探勘技術，並妥善應用其技術於改善臺灣所受之氣候變遷災害。由臺灣的災防需求出發，克服具有國際競爭力之前瞻研究議題，朝引領相關領域之世界學術研究先驅邁進。

13,climate-action,Local Government’s Disaster Prevention/Relief Energy Promotion and Deepening,"The Disaster Prevention/Relief administrative system must rely on the close cooperation between the various levels to be highly impactful. In the past, the township (village, city, district) government level, this local government maintains the closest relationship to the people, was lacking sufficient disaster relief ability, resources, and talents. To ensure the Disaster Prevention/Relief works efficiently, the Disaster Prevention/Relief Deepening Plan was funded and technically supported by the central government and continues to aid the township government level (village, city, district) and increase the Disaster Prevention/Relief strength to provide increased safety for people's lives and property. The NCKU Disaster Prevention Research Center has long cooperated with the Tainan City Government and developed strong relationships with the district offices to; conduct basic data collection, develop disaster simulation analysis, Disaster Prevention/Relief System review, Disaster Prevention/Relief System operational framework formulation, practical operation and correction of the Disaster Prevention/Relief System operation mechanism on a rolling basis. In order to cultivate Disaster Prevention/Relief capabilities, a variety of Disaster Prevention/Relief education and training sessions and contingency drills will be conducted. To provide assistance during the disaster, personnel will be dispatched to the Disaster Prevention/Relief Center to assist in the interpretation of information and agency responses. Innovative practices include pre-deployment and the construction of the nation's first contingency cloud service backup system for flood-prone areas, the establishment of the Disaster Prevention/Relief video system, the issuance of Chinese and English versions of the Disaster Prevention Manual for citizens in Tainan City, the establishment of local food banks in conjunction with neighboring companies, the establishment of dedicated cloud data storage systems for disaster prevention, the formation of strategic shelter alliances, and the setup of solar lighting disaster prevention and shelter signs.

14,life-below-water,"NCKU Holds Taiwan’s First Seminar on Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water, Attracting Enthusiastic Participation of Academic Research Institutions and Industries","With respect to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, on November 9, National Cheng Kung University held Taiwan’s first large-scale seminar on SDG 14: Life Below Water. The seminar was co-hosted by the University Center for Bioscience and Biotechnology, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, and Office of Research and Development and was co-organized by the Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, International Center for Scientific Development of Shrimp Aquaculture, Marine Biology and Cetacean Research Center, and Circular Economy Research Center. Attended by approximately 200 participants, the seminar was both lively and engaging. In addition to sharing NCKU’s research energy, the seminar was a declaration of the university’s determination to pursue SDG 14: Life Below Water.
During the opening ceremony, Tsair-Fuh Lin, Director of the Office of Research and Development, represented NCKU President Dr. Su Huey-Jen for the opening remarks. Lin observed that the university’s international collaboration efforts in underwater research have yielded abundant results. Participants came from National Taiwan University, National Taiwan Ocean University, National Sun Yat-Sen University, National Chung Hsing University, Tunghai University, National Dong Hwa University, National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium, Sunny Rich Power Co., Ltd, and NCKU Marine Biology and Cetacean Research Center and included renowned Taiwan scholars as well as young scholars with potential. Interdisciplinary content discussed in the seminar was presented in a clear and entertaining manner, and research and related topics were worded in a straightforward manner for the better understanding of participants. Throughout the event, participants remained attentive to presenters and were able to discuss relevant topics and interact with one another.
Topic 1: To create a novel algae-based sustainable circular economy, diverse species of algae can be grown in water ecosystems to provide a food source for most animals in aquatic food chains. As fundamental producers, algae determine the balance and stability of ocean ecosystems. Therefore, the cultivation of diverse algae species coincides with SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources. Discussion was first led by Professor Tse-Min Lee from National Sun Yat-sen University, who shared algae applications in pharmaceutical and food products and suggested that large-scale algae cultivation and restoration will further expand the scope of algae applications. Jo-Shu Chang, Director of College of Engineering, Tunghai University, elaborated on the wide scope of macroalgae applications and provided examples in bioenergy, health foods, fragrance and cosmetic products, aquaculture, and liquid fertilizer. Finally, Chun-Yen Chen, a University Center for Bioscience and Biotechnology researcher, provided a detailed account of current microalgae applications in industrial and animal husbandry wastewater treatment, Omnipork production, fragrance and cosmetic products, and aviation biofuel; microalgae applications thus embody the concept of “reuse” and help construct a sustainable circular economy.
Topic 2: National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium
Shao-En Peng, Executive Advisor of the Coral Reef Cultivation Center of National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium, suggested that we must predict future changes in the marine ecosystem and environment, and shared some of the museum’s research on reef biology, artificial propagation, cryopreservation, and mesophotic coral. In addition to contributing to the sustainable preservation of species diversity, the museum emphasizes the necessity of marine education.
President of Sunny Rich Power Co., Ltd, Kuei-Kuang Chen, held a session entitled “Incorporating Artificial Intelligence Smart Technology in Fishery and Electricity Symbiosis to Create a New Circular Economy for the Aquaculture Industry.” The session advocated setting “sustainable development for the earth” as the industry development goal, developing a multi-value green technology that can be reused and combined for large-scale and modular production, agriculture and fishery product value-adding, and fishing village reconstruction, and combining this technology with a smart cultivation system. Chen also used his personal experiences to encourage students to transform the agriculture and fisheries industry with technology, implement innovative ideas, develop a future outlook, and pass on the spirit of sustainable development.
Professor Han-Ching Wang, representative of the International Center for Scientific Development of Shrimp Aquaculture, shared the strategies and results of a novel sustainable shrimp farming and breeding method. Wang explained that by using years of research as a basis and an excellent shrimp farming method (i.e., artificial intelligence smart technology farming), the center had developed an effective, scientific breeding and farming method. Then, describing multiple approaches (e.g., to shrimp properties, the environment, pathogens, and business management), Wang analyzed how the high-efficiency shrimp cultivation project achieves sustainable development for the future in the face of environmental changes and food crises.
Topic 3: In the discussion on “Sustainable Fishery Under Environmental Changes,” Professor Tsong-Han Lee of the Department of Life Sciences, NCKU, led a discussion on why saltwater milkfish exhibit relatively stronger low temperature tolerance relative to freshwater milkfish. Lee expressed hope for the development of an effective method to resolve the issue of cold damage in milkfish farming and thus ensure the sustainability of milkfish, which has a long history in the aquaculture industry. Next, Dr. Guan-Chung Wu of the Department of Aquaculture, National Taiwan Ocean University, explained sex-determining and cellularization mechanisms in fish and assisted participants in predicting the latent impacts of environmental changes around the world on genital development in various fish species. Finally, Professor Tzong-Yueh Chen of the Department of Biotechnology and Bioindustry Sciences, NCKU, reported basic research outcomes in fish molecular breeding, fish pathogen detection, fish immunity, and fish aquaculture technology. Chen proposed a novel industrial technology chain for grouper aquaculture composed by connecting genomic molecule-assisted breeding systems, artificial intelligence fry production systems, microfluidic pathogen detection platforms, and immunosuppressive mechanism technological platforms. By combining smart agriculture technology with interdisciplinary technology, this industrial technology chain reduces cultivation and labor costs and accelerates sustainable development of Taiwan’s aquaculture industry in the face of climate change.
Topic 4: Regarding cetacean conservation, two domestic experts on stranded cetacean emergencies and the pathological anatomy of cetaceans, as well as the director of Marine Biology and Cetacean Research Center, were invited to share their experiences.
Wei-Cheng Yang, an associate professor with the School of Veterinary Medicine, National Taiwan University, has devoted over 20 years to rescuing, practicing conservation medicine for, and researching cetaceans. Yang detailed his observations of cetacean conservation events and relevant policy amendments, the increase in cetacean stranding incidents, and the implementation and practical application of cetacean conservation and conservation medicine in Taiwan over the past two decades. Yang stressed the criticalness of research and conservation medicine in the global effort to conserve cetaceans and shared findings of specific research projects in this area.
Eva Chen, a professor with the Marine Biology and Cetacean Research Center and a veterinarian, specializes in cetacean medicine, rescue, and pathological anatomy. Chen described the periodic evolution of Taiwan’s cetacean rescue and conservation medicine strategies over the past decade and shared her vision for the future of cetacean rescue and medicine.
Finally, Hao-Ven Wang, director of the Marine Biology and Cetacean Research Center, NCKU, provided an overview of the death of stranded cetaceans in Taiwan, incidents of live cetacean stranding, and cetacean stranding treatment processes and strategies. From an academic standpoint, Wang explained how these processes and experiences can be used to provide constructive suggestions for government policy formulation.

14,life-below-water,Implementation plan adapted to environmental change in Tainan coastal area (IMPACT),"It is held by the Department of Architecture, Department of Hydraulic and Ocean Engineering, Tainan Hydraulic Laboratory, Department of Urban Planning, Institute of Ocean Technology Marine Affairs and Department of Environmental Engineering. We aim to explore issues of coastal areas, inform students about the care of the surrounding area and social issues by bringing them deep into coastal areas, carry out SDGs and promote social responsibility.
Our issues were related to SDG14: Life Below, including a change of sandbar, sustainable oyster farming, ocean waste, and coastal environment and settlement culture. We do research, simplify and transmit knowledge regarding marine environments through courses, events and seminars. Our intentions are to change people’s views towards sustainable environment with education and together build a sustainable home.
Regarding the curriculum, related courses enabled students to learn about the change of sandbar and to improve communication skills during field trips to Beimen, Cigu and Jiangjun. Students experienced how to grow oysters. Concurrently, our team worked with oyster farmers to understand how monomer oyster farming overcomes decreases in lagoons. There were also practical courses regarding marine environments and precipitation, e.g. potential flooding map. Experts in marine preservation were invited to share knowledge and inform students.
This project enabled students and our team to transmit knowledge by conducting activities, exhibitions and presentations, a 1-day camp in Jiangjun and Cigu elementary schools, an educational booth in summer camp and beach cleaning in Milkfish Festival. Students learned and subsequently shared messages. In the education booth, we have various teaching aids, including Card of Flooding which teaches causes and corresponding solutions; and Oyster Farm Matching to identify various styles of oyster cultivation. All knowledge is based on our research, although it is simplified to an appropriate level to make it easier to understand and share.

14,life-below-water,Microalgae applied to the development of technology in aquaculture,"Shrimp is one of the high-priced aquaculture products. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) statistics, the global shrimp market in 2012 was 40 billion US dollars. The main markets are in Asia, Europe, North America, Central and South America, Africa and Oceania. Asia is the world's largest export region, accounting for 54.8% of the world's total exports in 2009. The top five exporting countries are Thailand, China, Vietnam, India and Indonesia. During 1984-1987, Taiwan’s shrimp farming practice flourished, creating Taiwan’s reputation as a “cultured shrimp kingdom”, mainly in the shrimp farming technology. However, the invasion of various shrimp viruses, drug use and abuse by farmers (disease control drugs, disinfectants, herbicides, insecticides, algae growth agents, hormones and antibiotics) created a negative environmental impact. Severe pollution with various chemicals effectively improved the drug resistance of environmental pathogens and high rate of untreatable infections could be seen among farmers, coastal organisms and aquatic products consumers. The current survival rate of White shrimp is less than 40%, and the survival rate of Kuruma prawn cultures is less than 20%. The annual output of shrimp farming in Taiwan is decreasing year by year. The point is that there is an increased incidence of cancer in humans every year since they are at the top of the food chain and bioaccumulation of several xenochemicals is inevitable. The food safety problem also cannot be ignored. Therefore, we attempted to develop a non-toxic healthy shrimp farming procedure with high survival rate and lower environmental impacts using sea water resources. The entire process is chemical free to ensure consumer safety and the farming procedure is sustainable. Our team has stepped into the aquaculture field with the unique advantages of microalgae/bacteria, emphasizing the concept of ecological balance for Black Tiger shrimp and Kuruma prawn culture. Using a variety of microalgae and probiotics that promote the growth of shrimps as a ""health food"" for shrimps, a high-quality and sustainable breeding environment was developed for shrimp culture with robust shrimp growth and higher survival rates without any antibiotics/drugs. This goal has also been favored by Silicon Valley Taiwan Angels (SVT Angels) to attract their investments. In addition, our team signed a MOU with OPBIO Factory Co., Ltd. (Okinawa, Japan) and Datuk, Malaysia. The application of microalgae/bacteria in aquaculture technology and its promotion in the international market will increase Taiwan's competitiveness.
蝦類為水產養殖業之高單價水產品之一，一般常見的蝦類包含淡水長臂大蝦、草蝦、沙蝦、斑節蝦、白蝦、螯蝦、龍蝦等。根據聯合國糧農組織（Food and Agriculture Organization，FAO）統計資料，2012年全球蝦類市場規模為400億美元，主要市場在亞洲、歐洲、北美洲、中南美、非洲與大洋洲，其中主要占最大市場為亞洲，約占全球58%；亞洲為全球最大出口地區，於2009年占全球總出口量的54.8%，主要前五大出口國分別為泰國、中國、越南、印度與印尼，其中泰國為蝦類出口的最主要國家。而台灣過去在1984-1987年時期，蝦類養殖曾蓬勃發展，創造了台灣「草蝦養殖王國」的榮景。但之後由於各種蝦類病毒侵襲，加上養殖戶過度使用各種藥物 (疾病防治藥、消毒劑、除草劑、殺蟲劑、藻類促長劑、賀爾蒙及抗生素)，造成對環境的衝擊及對水產品、沿海生物、水產物消費者產生毒害，無形中提高環境病菌的抗藥性，養殖物體內的藥物殘留，導致目前白蝦養殖之存活率皆不到四成，斑節蝦養殖存活率更低至不到二成。台灣養蝦年產量逐年下降，造成養蝦王國的稱號拱手讓人，且因藥物濫用導致居民的罹癌率逐年增加，食安問題實不可忽視。因此本研究團隊主要想創造無毒、高存活率、無環境衝擊、海水資源高度利用之蝦類養殖技術，發展健康養蝦程序，讓食者安心，以達綠色永續經營之概念。本團隊以獨步的藻種優勢，正式踏入水產養殖領域，強調以生態平衡概念進行白蝦、草蝦及斑節蝦養殖，利用多種可促進蝦類生長的微藻及益生菌作為蝦的『保健食品』，打造出優質的養殖環境，增強蝦體對環境的抵抗力，過程中不添加任何抗生素及藥物，以達到無毒無污染的蝦類養殖程序。此目標也因而獲得天使創投陳勁初先生的青睞及投資。除此之外，本團隊更與日本沖繩的OPBIO Factory Co., Ltd.以及馬來西亞廠商簽訂合作意願書，將微藻應用水產養殖技術推向國際，增加台灣國際競爭力。

14,life-below-water,Microalgae applied to livestock wastewater treatment,"According to the EPA's survey of land-based water pollution sources in Taiwan, livestock wastewater accounts for nearly 10% of all types of wastewater. Among them, piggery wastewater is the main source of pollution. If 30 liters per pig per day is produced, the amount of piggery wastewater produced in Taiwan is as high as 200,000 metric tons per day. At present, most of the wastewater treatment facilities used by domestic livestock farmers apply the three-stage wastewater treatment method developed and promoted by the Animal Production Research Institute of the Agriculture Committee. However, the wastewater currently discharged still contains high concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and mineral salts, causing serious environmental impact. In 2018, the Agriculture and Fisheries Commission promoted the direct land application of piggery wastewater for agricultural use. Studies have shown that direct discharge of piggery wastewater can alter the soil characteristics increasing the salinity, leaving the land in unusable conditions. Since carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus are the three most important elements for microalgal growth, piggery wastewater rich in these nutrients is very suitable as a sustainable nutrient source for microalgal cultivation. After laboratory tests, it has been shown that microalgae can not only effectively remove COD, nitrogen and phosphorus from piggery wastewater, but also produce liquid microalgal biomass for direct agricultural land irrigation without soil acidification. The microalgal biomass can be further fermented with special strains to produce liquid fertilizer with high economic value. Therefore, the use of microalgae to treat livestock wastewater can effectively purify wastewater and produce liquid microalgal biomass with high economic value, which is a promising technology with great development potential. The technology was interviewed by Discovery Channel in 2017 and premiered in public media on 2017.11.18. In 2018, it won the LEKO Technical Award from the TECO Green Tech International Contest.

根據環保署所做之台灣地區陸域水體污染來源調查顯示，畜牧廢水佔各類廢水總污染量將近十分之一，其中更以豬糞廢水為畜牧廢水主要的污染來源，若以每日每頭猪30公升之廢水量來計算，台灣每日所產生的猪糞尿廢水量高達20萬公噸。目前國內大多數畜牧業者所採用的廢水處理設施，大多數採用農委會畜產試驗所所研發、推廣之三段式廢水處理設施，但是目前所排放的廢水仍然含有高濃度的氮、磷以及含鹽物質，導致造成嚴重的環境衝擊，2018年農委會大力推廣的豬糞尿廢水直接澆灌農地的政策，但已有業者證實豬糞尿廢水直接澆灌，會造成土地氮、磷以及含鹽物質大幅提高，導致無法耕種，因此豬糞尿廢水應用於農地之實際澆灌量非常少。由於碳氮磷是藻類行光合作用最重要的3大元素，豬糞尿廢水剛好含有豐富的碳氮磷，非常適合作為藻類的營養來源，經過實驗室的初步測試，小球藻不僅能有效去除豬糞尿廢水的COD以及氮磷，所產生的藻液更可直接進行農地澆灌而不會有土壤酸化的問題，藻液更可進一步與特殊菌種共發酵以生產高經濟價值的液態肥料。因此，利用微藻發展畜牧廢水處理系統可有效淨化廢水並生產具有高經濟價值的藻體，是極具發展潛力的前瞻技術。該技術於2017年榮獲Discovery Channel採訪，並於2017.11.18於公眾媒體首播；並於2018年獲得東元「Green Tech」國際創意競賽「LEKO低碳技術獎」；於2017年與越南Asia Nutrition Technologies Co., Ltd.簽訂國際技轉共70,000美金，並同時執行3件國際合作計畫；2018年更完成與英屬開曼群島商納諾股份有限公司台灣分公司之技轉案，劑轉金額為1,000萬新台幣。

14,life-below-water,Sustainable development of fish aquaculture,"Ocean covers almost 70% of the Earth surface; in addition to providing water resources, it also contributes a wide variety of food resources to support the global population. Eventually, when land resources have been virtually completely exploited, humans will alter their focus towards exploiting ocean resources. Consequently, ensuring sustainable development of oceans, seas and marine resources is a main priority that needs to be initiated.
Illegal fishing and in particular overfishing has decimated the marine industry, not only in Taiwan, but globally. Consequently, many countries have initiated science-based research to develop a new strategy for maintaining fish stocks and improving breeding stock quality and quantity. Taiwan has abundant ocean fish resources; however, without proper management, ocean fish resources are rapidly depleting and unable to support demand. The resulting crisis cannot be addressed solely by traditional breeding methods. To achieve sustainable development, the NCKU grouper team, lead by Prof. Tzong-Yueh Chen of the Department of Biotechnology and Bioindustry Sciences, has the view that traditional aquaculture must adopt technology. Cross-field cooperation is encouraged and indeed is becoming an important trend worldwide. Furthermore, genetic technologyies to identify markers for high growth and high disease resistance can be used to identify the best quality grouper broodstock; consequently, this can help reduce harvest of wild fish and indirectly achieve SDGs. Providing sufficient food resources can help eradicate poverty and reaching milestones of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by developing functional aquafeed additives to address the food crisis. In the future, with improved technology, more innovative breeding techniques for aquaculture can be developed and used to sustain oceans, seas and marine resources.
海洋占地球接近七成的面積，除了提供水資源，它也爲全球人口提供了各種糧食資源，當陸地資源陸續被開發耗盡後，人類不得不轉向開發海洋資源。漁業對於全球糧食安全、百姓生計與經濟發展佔有重要的貢獻。在沒有完善持續管理下，過度捕撈將破壞魚類棲息地，魚類種群應要保持在生物可持續發展的數量内，或是依據它們的生物特性來生產最大永續發展的魚獲量。非法與過度捕撈除了重創臺灣海洋產業領域，也逐漸升格為全球議題，先進國家已開始通過科學研究投入，尋找可以維持魚類種群以及提高種魚族群質量與數量的新策略。臺灣擁有優勢的地理形勢與海洋資源，但缺少妥善管理的問題造成海洋與大量魚類資源快速消耗枯竭，供不應求，這也形成了對海洋漁業的種種問題，過度依賴傳統育種方法完全跟不上資源消耗速度。傳統養殖業搭配先進科技技術進行跨領域合作是目前全球的趨勢，由本校生物科技與產業科學系的陳宗嶽教授所帶領成功大學石斑魚團隊，利用遺傳技術準確標定高成長、高抗病關鍵基因可協助篩選高品質種魚族群，培育出快速成長子代，除提升經濟效益外，也可減少野外海洋捕撈，達到永續發展目標。此外，該團隊也發展出水產機能性飼料添加物，加快水產養殖魚類生長，提供更有效益的養殖技術，協助克服糧食危機，提供足夠的糧食資源可以消除飢餓、改善營養，同時達到聯合國2030永續發展目標。在長遠的目標下，利用更進一步的生物科技研發與改良更精準的分子育種技術，期盼協助克服糧食危機的同時達成保育及永續利用海洋與海洋資源，以確保全球永續發展。

14,life-below-water,Research and breeding program of shrimp for the next generation,"According to the United Nation’s FAO, development of aquaculture is associated with several main SDGs, including SDG 2, SDG 13 and SDG 14. Currently, among >70 countries engaged in shrimp farming, Asian countries are responsible for >70% of total production. However, aquatic disease issues coupled with climatic and ecological changes are the biggest impediments of shrimp aquaculture to achieve these SDGs. Consequently, our NCKU shrimp team is committed to innovating and producing science-based solutions of disease prevention to increase sustainability of shrimp aquaculture and ultimately the world.
Our NCKU shrimp team, lead by Profs. Chu-Fang Lo and Han-Ching Wang of the Department of Biotechnology and Bioindustry Sciences, head a state-of-the-art shrimp breeding program and have established a world-class research center, the “International Center for Scientific Development of Shrimp Aquaculture” at the AnNan Campus of NCKU in 2018. This center includes two laboratories for shrimp scientific research, two OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) reference laboratories for two emerging pathogens WSD/AHPND and two nuclear breeding center buildings. To achieve a sustainable shrimp aquaculture industry, the Center focuses on the following important issues: (1) control measures to minimize risks of disease outbreak and transmission; (2) genetically based production of specific pathogen free (SPF)/specific pathogen resistant (SPR) shrimp; and (3) shrimp culture systems that conserve energy and water. The center sustains high-quality SPF/SPR shrimp through their complete life cycle using an indoor culture facility with a high level of biosecurity, a closed circulation water system and artificial intelligence to control water quality, light, and feeding.
To move forward on SDG14 combined with several related SDGs, in 2018 the NCKU shrimp team initiated establishment of a commercial ecosystem for shrimp farming in a 9 Ha area in eastern Taiwan. We anticipate that this system will be able to connect the scientific output of shrimp aquaculture from our NCKU shrimp team with the environment and the shrimp industry. The NCKU shrimp team also inspires students to adopt interdisciplinary learning and critical thinking to integrate society/industry and to develop confidence to address future challenges. This team, combined with outstanding NCKU professors from a variety of fields, guided the students to innovate “No problem: A Biological approach to nitrate sensing and regulation” and won a gold medal and the championship for the “Best Environment Project” in the 2017 iGEM sponsored by MIT. Our goal is to achieve academic excellence by addressing critical topics at the leading-edge of the interplay among shrimp-pathogen-environment, generate new knowledge that can be translated into key technologies, management and approaches to make cultured shrimp a more efficient and sustainable industry, thereby enhancing both science and society.
FAO的要點提及，水產養殖的發展與數個重要全球永續發展目標SDG有所關聯，如SDG2、SDG13及SDG14等。現今約有70多個國家積極參與蝦類養殖，其中亞洲國家的產量更是佔了超過全球總產量的70%。然而，水生疾病議題、環境變遷及氣候變遷已嚴然成為蝦類水產養殖要達成這些永續發展目標的最大挑戰。因此，為了全球蝦類水產養殖的永續發展，NCKU蝦類團隊從蝦類品質及管理上著手，致力於開發以科學為基礎的疾病預防策略。
NCKU蝦類團隊主為本校生物科技與產業科學系的羅竹芳教授及王涵青教授所帶領，引領最先進的蝦類科學育種計畫外，並自2018年於NCKU安南校區建立世界級研究中心-前瞻蝦類養殖國際研發中心。此中心內含2間蝦類學術研究實驗室、2間專為蝦類重要疾病-WSD/AHPND-所建立之世界動物衛生組織OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health)參考實驗室，以及2棟核心蝦類育種中心館。為達成蝦類水產養殖的永續目標，此中心針對下列重要議題進行探討: (1) 減少疾病爆發和傳播風險的控制措施; (2) specific pathogen free (SPF)/specific pathogen resistant (SPR) 之蝦隻育種; (3)節能節水的綠色蝦類養殖系統。該中心在蝦隻生長的完整生命週期中，使用高水平生物安全性室內培養設施、封閉循環水系統以及人工智能控制水質、餵食和光照調控，以維持高品質SPF / SPR蝦隻培育。
在結合SDG14及其他相關SDG行動上，NCKU蝦類團隊於2018年開始在台灣東部建立9公頃蝦類養殖商業生態系統，我們期待該系統將能夠將NCKU蝦類團隊的蝦類水產養殖學術成果與環境和產業做實務串連。不僅止於科學研究，NCKU 蝦類團隊也投入教育中，激勵學生進行跨域學習、對社會及產業具備批判性思維，並對未來充滿信心。該團隊與來自跨域傑出的NCKU 教授合作，共同引導學生創作 ""No problem: A Biological approach to nitrate sensing and regulation""，用以偵測並解決養殖水體可能所產生的汙染，此作品在2017年時獲得由麻省理工學院贊助的 iGEM的金牌和 ""最佳環境專案"" 總冠軍。NCKU蝦類團隊期許藉由解決蝦隻-病原體-與環境間相互作用之重要議題，以達成卓越的學術目標，進而產生可轉化為關鍵技術的新知識與管理辦法，並提升蝦類養殖效率及產業的永續發展，以增進學術與社會的福祉。

14,life-below-water,NCKU Cetacean Research Center restores Taiwan’s first blue whale specimen,"NCKU Marine Biology and Cetacean Research Center is now cleaning and preserving the skeleton of the world’s largest whale. The blue whale expired some time ago and drifted in the ocean. It was stranded on a beach in Taitung in January, 2020. After being transported back to NCKU, the skull was found to be severely damaged and shattered. This blue whale is a juvenile whale, which has more cartilage and is not easy to preserve. It is a difficult project to create a full skeleton specimen. Wang Hao-Wen, director of NCKU Marine Biology and Cetacean Research Center, said that the team will pull out all stops to complete the first blue whale specimen in Taiwan.
The first blue whale stranded in Taiwan
""In the past, there are no records of sightings or strandings of blue whales in Taiwan. According to the data, there were 14 records of capture around the Taiwan area during the 1920-1938 period, but there is no exact record of a capture location."", said Wang Hao-Wen, director of the NCKU Marine Biology and Cetacean Research Center. For decades, no  blue whale has been recorded in the Taiwan region. According to the ""Taiwan's Whale and Dolphin legend"" provided by the Forestry Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, there are nearly 30 observed species from the smaller dolphins to the larger sperm whale, of which there are no blue whales. In addition to understanding the cause of death, the blue whale stranding event has a great significance for the research of blue whales around the world if the bones can be properly preserved.
In the face of climate change, marine conservation issues have received greater attention. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has included blue whales in the ""IUCN Red List of Threatened Species."" Scientists estimate that between 5,000 and 15,000 exist now. The events of illegal fishing or stranding incidents have always attracted great attention from animal protection groups and academia.
Wang Hao-Wen pointed out that according to the necropsy evidence, the blue whale was no more than three years old. According to the literature, the blue whale is 7 meters long at birth, and can reach 15 meters in length in approximately 7-months, and achieve a maximum length of 30 meters. The life span of the blue whale is estimated to be 80 to 90 years , and some experts believe the blue whale can reach 110 years!
Difficult task for blue whale research
The NCKU Marine Biology and Cetacean Research Center is located in the southwest corner of the NCKU Annan Campus. The room is filled with whale bones that have been processed for many years. Wang Hao-Wen, professor Wang Jian-Ping NCKU student volunteers, veterinary departments from various universities, and volunteers transported and dissected the blue whale successfully.
Wang Hao-Wen emphasized that this is the first record of blue whale stranded in Taiwan in nearly a century. At present, there are not many countries displaying blue whale solid bone specimens, as far as he knows, there are only Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom have displayed. If this blue whale will be exhibited in the future, NCKU will be the first place in Taiwan to display blue whale specimens.
Talking about the process of processing the blue whale, Wang Hao-Wen said, ""This whale has been hungry for too long."" He said; “All the internal organs have decayed, and the muscles have degenerated into blood-like substance.” Although he tried to find food from the remains of the esophagus, stomach and intestine, he found no trace of food. The subcutaneous fat layer was very thin, so it is reasonable to infer that the whale had not eaten for a long period of time.

Wang Hao-Wen pointed out that climate change and global warming can contribute to the cause of death, and by analyzing the carcass we can ascertain how the individual died. A few days ago, he went to Mai-Liao（麥寮）Port to process a dead False killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens). is the death was probably related to aging, because the teeth were ground flat and the fat layer was thin. It can be presumed that the body was in a weakened state and had no predation ability.
Drift gill net entrapped bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)
Wang Hao-Wen's testimony of an example of a bottlenose dolphin ,who went to the Zhang-Bin Industrial Zone（彰濱工業區） recently. ""It was entangled in the gill net. Is the death related to the entanglement of the gill net? It is necessary to prove this and then find out the reason. The dolphin is estimated to have died more than three weeks ago, and much of the evidence has disappeared. The stomach was found empty during the dissection, which means there has been no food intake for a long time period before death, and the subcutaneous fat layer was relatively thin. In general, dolphins entangled in fishing nets cannot break free could drown. However, this dolphin does not have this situation. It is necessary to further analyze.”
Wang Hao-Wen said, ""It was sad to find that blue whale mouth was entangled with fishing nets. The blue whale food intake method is to open their mouth and inhale copious amounts of seawater, then the mouth is closed and then the abdomen elastically retracts to squeeze out the seawater. The baleen plates will filter out small fish and shrimp for consumption. If the mouth can’t be opened properly, it will inhibit eating. ""According to the information collected now, I know that the fishing net was the cause of death.  This net is a type of fishing gear used by common fishing methods. The world has begun to reflect on this situation and recommend more ‘whale’ friendly fishing gear and greater fishing conservation behavior. The 14th goal of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal mentions the importance of Marine protection. We should work hard to restore and understand the circumstances of the blue whale death, and discover things from this evidence, and remind humanity of the serious consequences.
成功大學海洋生物暨鯨豚研究中心現正進行台灣有紀錄以來首見、全世界最大型生物藍鯨的骨架清洗與去腐保存工作。這隻藍鯨死亡多時，隨海洋漂流，2020年1月擱淺在台東海灘。經運回成大解剖後發現頭骨粉碎嚴重，而且該藍鯨屬於少年鯨，軟骨較多、不易保存，要製作全骨架標本是一件浩大工程。成大鯨豚中心主任王浩文表示，團隊將全力以赴，務必完成台灣第一個藍鯨標本。
第一隻藍鯨死亡擱淺台灣
「過去台灣並無藍鯨被目擊或擱淺的記錄，雖然日本統治台灣時期，南部有捕鯨船進出，根據資料記載1920-1938年期間，台灣周圍海域有14頭被捕獲的紀錄，但並沒有確切地記載捕獲地點。」成大鯨豚中心主任王浩文說，幾十年來，藍鯨都沒有在台灣周遭出現 的記錄。據行政院農委會林務局提供「臺灣的鯨豚」圖例，從體型最小的海豚、大至抹香鯨，多達近30種，其中沒有藍鯨。這次藍鯨擱淺事件，除了解死亡原因外，若能妥善保存全身骨頭，並製作成標本，對全世界藍鯨的研究具有重大意義。
面對氣候變遷，海洋生態保育議題也備受關注，國際自然保護聯盟(IUCN) 已將藍鯨列入「瀕危物種紅皮書」，科學家估計現存約5千隻至1萬5千隻之間，每發現違法捕撈或海灘擱淺事件，總引起動保團體與學界高度重視。
王浩文指出，依照解剖後所有的證據推論，該藍鯨不超過三歲。依已知的資料，藍鯨出生時身長就有7公尺，約7個月時身長可達15公尺，最大能達30公尺，學界研究藍鯨壽命最少有80-90歲，也有專家研究指出其壽命可達到110歲。
藍鯨實體研究任務艱困
成大鯨豚中心位於成大安南校區西南一隅，室內擺滿多年來處理的鯨骨，就連長達十多公尺的抹香鯨標本都以緊縮椎間盤方式存放著 。王浩文與退而不休的王建平教授有師生情緣，幸而有王建平老師全力支援，加上成大學生及多所大學的獸醫系與各界志工協助，讓這次台灣百年罕見的藍鯨運送、解剖順利完成，並將進一步分析研究死因，以及嘗試建置標本。
王浩文強調，這是台灣近百年第一次有藍鯨擱淺的記錄，現在世界各國都想要有一隻真的藍鯨骨頭標本，目前展示藍鯨實體骨頭標本的國家不多，就他所知的有加拿大、美國、英國。如果這隻藍鯨未來展出，成大將是台灣第一個展示藍鯨標本的地方。目前師徒仍持續合作，為此重責大任而努力。
談及處理藍鯨過程，王浩文感慨「這隻鯨實在餓太久了。」他說：體內所有內臟都爛掉，肌肉也都化成血水，雖嘗試從食道、胃和腸道的殘骸找食物的痕跡，但都找不到任何食物的殘留；而且皮下脂肪層很薄，因此合理推論牠應該有很長時間無法進食。
許多民眾及政府官員會好奇詢問，為何鯨魚死了還要處理？王浩文指出，氣候變遷及全球暖化問題，其實可以從死亡的個體找出死亡原因，去分析 每隻鯨豚為什麼死亡，前幾天他到麥寮港口處理一隻已死的偽虎鯨，很可能就與老化有關，因為牙齒已經磨的非常平了，且脂肪層變薄，可推測身體非常虛弱，沒有捕食能力。
流刺網纏繞瓶鼻海豚
鯨豚死亡的另一原因，王浩文以日前到彰濱工業區處理一隻瓶鼻海豚的例子為見證，「牠身上有流刺網的漁網纏繞，死亡是不是跟流刺網的纏繞有關，就必須去證明及發現其原因，該隻海豚估計死亡三個星期以上，很多證據都消失了。解剖後胃是空的，代表死亡前已經有一段時間未進食，且皮下脂肪層也比較薄；一般海豚被漁網纏繞可能因為掙脫，有可能會嗆水，但這隻海豚沒有這個情況，沒有嗆水又被漁網纏繞，那牠死亡和漁網纏繞有沒有直接關係？」也有必要進一步去分析。
王浩文說，「這次台東長濱擱淺藍鯨，很難過的發現其嘴上纏繞著漁網，而藍鯨進食方式是張嘴灌進大量海水至下巴，再閉起嘴靠腹部彈性縮回同時擠出海水，鯨鬚板會將小魚小蝦卡住，若無法正常張開即影響進食。」現在收集到的資料，知道這漁網是屬於某種捕漁法使用的漁具，但屬於哪一類的漁具還要送請專家分析。不過，至少可判斷跟漁業行為有關，而流刺網該不該禁一直有討論，全世界已開始反思友善漁具及友善漁業行為，聯合國永續目標十七項裡第十四項也提到重視海洋保護，這些都讓他深感責任重大，應努力還原與了解藍鯨死亡擱淺事件的原貌，看能否從這些證據上找到可以反過來提醒人類的事情。

The College of Life Sciences of NCKU has kept track of the flora and fauna on campus and has given advice on minimizing the damage of the environment during the development of the campus. Simultaneously, the College of Life Sciences took part in the rescue, research and protection of cetaceans in Taiwan’s territorial waters. According to the suggested classification and standard of the International Union for Conservation of Nature( IUCN) and the listed species in The Red List of Flora and Fauna of Taiwan, the College of Life Sciences also made efforts on the substantial use of the land, conservation of endangered species, and reduction of introduced species. The following passages make clearer explanation of such efforts:
Conservation of endangered species
This passage respectically explains the conservation of endangered/ rare flora and fauna according to the suggested classification of the IUCN and the listed species in The Red List of Flora and Fauna of Taiwan.
For the flora, through research, NCKU has 32 species on campus, including Little-leaf Tree Millettia, Balobo, Oldham Elaeagnus, Blueberrylite Persimmon,Kusano Willow, Common Garcinia, Taiwan red pine, Taiwan Golden-rain Tree, Lanyu Michelia, Taiwan Ebony, Taiwan Roseapple, Largeleaf Markingnut, Chinese Elm, Lanyu Eugenia, Incense Tree, Taiwan Incense Cedar, Chinese Podocarpus, Swamp Gelonium, Indian barringtonia, Diospyros ferrea, Small-leaved Barringtonia, and Cagayan Nutmeg. NCKU has taken planned and regular observation of these species, and set up a stable and healthy environment for them to grow steadily.
For fauna, through investigation and measurement, NCKU has 12 kinds of birds on campus, including Crested Goshawk, Brown Hawk-owl, Black-shouldered Kite, Crested Serpent-eagle, Osprey, Grey-faced buzzard, Chinese Goshawk, Spotted Scops Owl, Lanius cristatus, Oriental Pratincole, Painted Snipe, and Ring-necked Pheasant. Also, there are 3 kinds of reptiles, including Orthriophis taeniurus friesei, grass-flower, and Plumbeous water snake.
Meanwhile, the protected cetaceans that were rescued in recent year including Steno bredanensis, sperm whale, Pygmy Sperm Whale, Dwarf sperm whale, Striped Dolphin, Risso's Dolphin, Pygmy Killer Whale, Short finned pilot whale, and many-toothed blackfish. Other protected marine species that have been rescued are green sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, Lepidochelys olivacea, and Leatherback Turtle.
Reduction of exotic species
With the constant effort of maintaining the flora on campus, most exotic species, even the alien invasive species, are under controlled. However, in Annan Campus, the biggest campus of NCKU, the higher rainfall frequency in recent years together with the taprography caused frequent flooding on campus. Due to this reason, the number of white popinac leadtree increased. Recently, NCKU used drainage systems to drain away excessive water and planted more local plants which can adapt to the environment near the seashore. Moreover, for maintaining the biological diversity, other species were planted ,including Terminalia catappa, Poongaoil Pongamia, China Berry, Flame Gold-rain Tree, Hibiscus tiliaceus, Scaevola taccada, Myoporum, and Seaside Clerodendrum.

15,life-on-land,Classroom by the Sea: On-Site Science Education Provided by the NCKU USR Project,"As part of the NCKU University Social Responsibility (USR) Project, an environment education booth was set up at Liukong Wharf in Cigu District, Tainan, on July 13 and 14 under the invitation of the District Chief, Ping-Ping Hsu, and with the assistance of the Chief of the Agriculture and Development Division, Kuo-An Huang. The booth was managed by members of the project’s IMPACT team, postdoctoral fellow Shing-Ru Yang, and research assistants Min-Chi Wen, I-ting Wu, Shuk-Yin Li, Chi-chia Tsao, Yu-fen Chen, Jui Ming, and Hideaki Ikemoto. In the spirit of science education, the booth promoted the key aspects of the NCKU USR Project, including oyster farming, climate change, and improvement of asparagus quality by planting it in a greenhouse. Similar to the arrangement last year, the booth passed on detailed knowledge through interactive games, educating visitors of the phenomena and causal relationships behind environmental change.
For example, one of the games involved the life cycle of the milkfish and flathead grey mullet. These are the primary economic species farmed in Cigu. The milkfish is highly vulnerable to cold, whereas the flathead grey mullet is vulnerable to heat. Therefore, because of ongoing environmental change, both a severe cold front and a warm winter can damage the local fish farming industry. Through the game, visitors learned the economic value of these species and their preferred environmental conditions. Additionally, through the referral of coFishland, an organization that promotes fishery education, a farmer of flathead grey mullet, Chuang-Hui Chiu, was invited to share his experience at the booth, particularly the details of fish farming and challenges he encounters, which gave people insight and firsthand knowledge. His vivid description piqued the people’s interest, and many questions were asked. Because the roe of flathead grey mullet is a common delicacy in Taiwan but people rarely have the opportunity to see a flathead grey mullet in the flesh, the game delivered a profound experience.
Two major aspects of the NCKU USR Project, namely the improvement of oyster farming techniques and net-house farming of asparagus, were explained in the form of a collage game and tabletop game, respectively. The collage game about oyster farming first informed the player of the various types of oyster rack developed according to local marine geographical features and industrial needs (horizontal hanging, vertical hanging, and floating raft); the player then had to attach the sticker of the rack type appropriate to various regions on a map of Tainan. Examples of all rack types were present around the site, enabling visitors to readily compare them. Numerous visitors, particularly parents with children, asked about the possible environmental risks posed by floating rafts, which is indicative of the growing awareness among the public of problems associated with aquaculture and the environment.

The tabletop game about asparagus farming was designed by Yi-Wei Hsu, a student who attended the Outdoor Physical Environment Quantitative Assessment course of Professor Tzu-Ping Lin at the Department of Architecture. Hsu integrated the net-house temperature regulation strategy that is taught in the course into the gameplay and designed an impact–adaptation game that enables the player to learn of the available temperature regulation methods that can be used when the environmental temperature is high. This game is suitable for all ages, which made it the most popular game in the booth. Many visitors inquired whether there were plans to publish the game.
The Classroom by the Sea is an initiative that combines NCKU’s spirit of academic research and science education with community-based activities. The university integrates the latest developments in environmental science into the design of interactive teaching aids, enabling people to acquire knowledge easily and in a relaxed environment. Through this strategy, environmental knowledge and scientific spirit cease to be unapproachable domains; they become something that people can easily relate to in daily life.
This project is a part of a University USR project sponsored by the Ministry of Education, titled the 2019 Implementation Plan Adapted to Environmental Change in Tainan Coastal Area (IMPACT). It is jointly led by Distinguished Professor Tzu-Ping Lin of the Department of Architecture, Associate Professor Yi Chang of the Institute of Ocean Technology and marine Affairs, Deputy Director Wen-Son Chiang and Professor Shih-Chun Hsiao of the Tainan Hydraulics Laboratory, Associate Professor Chia-Hua Chang of the Department of Environmental Engineering, Associate Professor Cheng-Luen Hsueh of the Department of Architecture, and Assistant Professor Tai-Lin Huang of the Department of Urban Planning. The team is assisted by Professor Jiann-Yeou Rau of the Department of Geomatics, who is in charge of aerial photography and three-dimensional modelling of the shoreline and coastal communities. The objective of IMPACT is to investigate the effects of environmental change on the coastal zone of Tainan; raise awareness of concerns regarding the local environment and social problems among young students; lead students to join forces with coastal communities in the adaptation to climate change; implement the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations; and fulfill the university’s social responsibilities.

15,life-on-land,NCKU Research Team Unveils the Genome Sequence and Evolution of Orchids,"National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) Institute of Tropical Plant Sciences Associate Professor Wen-Chieh Tsai, Department of Life Sciences Associate Professor Song-Bin Chang and Orchid Research and Development Center Dr. Yu-Yun Hsiao jointly conducted an international study of the genome sequence of Apostasia shenzhenica (擬蘭). Their paper,“The Apostasia genome and the evolution of orchids”, has been published in Nature today.
The team included 35 researchers from 17 research institutes in Taiwan, China, Belgium, and Japan. Among them are 6 from NCKU; Tsai is listed as the co-corresponding author, and Hsiao the joint first author.
“Orchids carry special meanings for NCKU as well as the greater Tainan area in terms of research, culture and industry,” said NCKU President Huey-Jen Jenny Su in today’s press conference.
Professor Tsai noted, “The team sequenced the Apostasia shenzhenica genome and annotated 21,841 protein-coding genes to solve the hundred-year-old puzzle of the orchid’s evolution.”
There are about 30,000 species of orchids growing in almost every habitat except the north and south poles and extremely hot deserts. Among the extant orchids, Apostasia shenzhenica is one of the most primitive, and its morphological characters are quite different from others, providing a good example to demonstrate the genetic mechanisms of the orchid’s evolution.
As the biggest family among flowering plants (approximately 10%), the orchid’s diversity has been an attractive topic of study for scientists since Darwin.
“I never was more interested in any subject in my life, than in this of Orchids,” wrote Darwin to one of his friends.
“Darwin’s quest for the evolution of orchids was fulfilled by our research team,” added President Su.
Orchids have three sepals and three petals (of which one has specialized to form the labellum with different shapes and colors), stamens and pistil fused into a gynostemium, and pollens unified into pollinium on the stigma. With external pollination, they produce hundreds of thousands of seeds without endosperm. The seeds must intergrow with orchid mycorrhizal fungi for germinating.
However, Apostasia shenzhenica has no specialized labellum, its pollens are powdery, and it is a terrestrial but not epiphytic orchid.
The study of the genome sequence of Apostasia shenzhenica proves there was a whole-genome duplication of orchids. The comparative analyses show the changes within MADS-box gene classes during orchid evolution and the forming of specialized organs are the main causes of the extraordinary diversity of orchids.
The team pointed out, “deciphering the genome sequence of Apostasia shenzhenica helps understand the orchid’s functional evolution and adapting process, and could be applied to precise breeding of orchids to cultivate new varieties adaptable to extreme climate.”
Most orchids are insect-pollinated and symbiotic with fungi in nature and therefore, are important ecological indicator species.
“Knowing the process of the orchid’s evolution and adaption also explores the ecological balance and provides data and references for environmental changes,” concluded the team.
蘭花樣貌變化多端，其中奧秘，逾一世紀來科學家百思不解。成功大學與國際團隊合作，完成原始蘭花「擬蘭」全基因體解序，一舉解開蘭科植物演化之謎。成大團隊指出，基因體序列的解密，將被應用於蘭花精準育種，人們隨心所欲培育蘭花品種指日可待。這項突破性的研究 9 月 21 日榮登國際科研界排名第一的 Nature 期刊，並將台灣蘭花研究和產業推向另一個高峰。
論文題名為「The Apostasia genome and the evolution of orchids（擬蘭基因體與蘭花演化）」，研究團隊指出，藉由分析比對現存最原始的蘭科植物之一「擬蘭」（Apostasia shenzhenica）與一般蘭花外觀特徵基因，證實MADS-box基因家族成員的保留與消失，是蘭科物種演化過程中形成多樣化的重要原因。該研究由成大熱帶植物科學究所副教授蔡文杰、蘭花研究中心助理研究員蕭郁芸，及生命科學系副教授張松彬等 6 人，協同中國、比利時、日本等國共17個研究單位共同參與。蔡文杰名列共同通訊作者，蕭郁芸則名列共同第一作者。
成大團隊表示，精準育種除可改變花形，亦有助開發適應極端氣候的新品種。蘭花在大自然中需與真菌共生，是一個重要的生態指標，了解蘭花演化與適應的調控過程可了解生態之間的微妙平衡，為不可預期的環境變化提供更多的數據與參考。
成大 21 日與外界分享研究成果。蘇慧貞校長表示，成大年輕團隊研究成果，登上國際科研界最重要的期刊 Nature, 對台灣的研究來說是重要的里程碑，對成大來說也具有多重義意，團隊成員都屬青壯世代，是成大生科系創系以來培育出的學者。此外，論文國外的合作學者，在日本擔任大學教授的一位成員，也是成大畢業校友，這在在顯示成大科學的能量與競爭力。而更讓人興奮的是，該研究讓達爾文多的年遺憾，得到完整解答。
蘭花演化謎團的科學探究始於1862年，當時，達爾文收到一朵來自馬達加斯加島嶼奇特的蘭花(大慧星風蘭)，花朵後方，竟然有長達30公分的細長花距，前所未來有構造，讓達爾文不斷思考，為什麼，提出一定有某種蛾類，口器伸長可超過 30 公分，如果這種蛾類消失，大慧風蘭也會滅絕的觀點； 直到1903年科學家才在馬達加斯加島發現一種口器展開長達 30 公分的天蛾。1992 年科學家終於記錄到這種天蛾拜訪大慧星風蘭，協助傳粉。
蘭與天蛾共同演化外，少數蘭已轉變為鳥類傳粉，花距變短、寬度增加，以符合鳥嘴型狀，百年來科學家一直極欲探究蘭花演化出多樣性的奧秘。
現今蘭科植物的特徵為，花瓣兩側對稱，下方一片不同形狀和色彩的花瓣（稱為唇瓣），中間一個蕊柱，頂端是花粉集結成團的花粉塊。另外，蘭花種子沒有胚乳，種子需與蘭菌共生才能發芽。科學界已知，MADS-box 家族基因調控蘭花的花萼、花瓣、唇瓣、蕊柱、花粉塊等花器官。
擬蘭，雖是蘭科植物的一員，花的外表與一般蘭花大不相同，外觀無變形的花瓣(唇瓣)和完整的蕊柱，沒有花粉團塊而是顆粒，特別的是，擬蘭長於土壤，現在的蘭全是附生在其他植物或岩石上等。
擬蘭全基因體解序後，團隊將其基因體數據，與一般蘭花做比對與分析，結果顯示，擬蘭雖無一般蘭科植物共同的明顯特徵(如唇瓣)，但仍然有MADS-box基因家族，在花瓣、蕊柱、花萼、花粉等部位，都可見 MADS-box 基因家族調控的作用。證實蘭科植物為了生存，演化過程中MADS-box基因家族部份成員保留與消失，是物種多樣化的重要原因之一。
少了 MADS-box 家族基因成員 B-AP3 與 E 群，擬蘭沒有特殊的唇瓣，也缺少完整的蕊柱。P 和 S-subclades 基因會調控花粉呈散開的顆粒狀，現今蘭花少了 P-subclades 基因，花粉集結成團塊。
擬蘭的根只能在地下生長，而今的蘭花攀附到樹上或岩壁上，是因為有可以吸收空氣中養份與儲存水分的氣根，這是 MADS-box 家族中 AGL12 等基因的影響。擬蘭全基因體解序，揭開了蘭花演化之謎。

16,peace-justice-and-strong-institutions,Pursuing Science in Battlefield: Yemeni Researcher,"The worst humanitarian crisis in decades is happening right now in Yemen; however, the conflict in Yemen didn’t stop Fathiah Zakham from pursuing science.
Fathiah Zakham, an assistant researcher at the Hodeidah University, Hodeidah, Yemen, is one of the five winners of 2017 Gro Brundtland Award. At her arrival in Taiwan, she unveils a gentle complexion with a lovely smile saying, “It takes me almost 7 days to travel from Hodeidah to Taipei because the situation in Yemen is so difficult.”
Winning the Gro Brundtland Award means a lot to Zakham. She says, “I am a female Yemeni researcher coming from a country suffering from war and humanitarian crisis and this award will provide me a hope for better achievement and advancement of science and make me more motivated.”
Growing up in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and then Hodeida, Yemen, Zakham has great passion to discover the secret of life and an interest in genomics.
She holds a PhD in Microbiology and Molecular biology within the UFR (Immunology-Biochemistry), faculty of science in the Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco. Now she works at the laboratory of microbiology at the School of Medicine and Health Science in Hodeidah University.
“I am working on the field of the transmissible diseases and I try to diffuse the elementary notions of hygiene and infectious disease prevention in order to protect public health,” she says.
Zakham’s main topic of research is the direct diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), the causal agent of tuberculosis and the detection of Multidrug resistant tuberculosis strains. She is also working on other bacterial resistance, especially in Gram negative bacteria.
“For my postdoctoral studies, I would like to design, characterize and investigate novel biodegradable polymer particles for the delivery of vaccine antigens and to measure the protective efficacy and the immunological response induced by those vaccines,” she adds.
Attending the Gro Brundtland Week 2017 in Taiwan, Zakham is looking forward to creating new collaborations with other scientists from around the world. Her goal is to build and create a network for fighting TB and other infectious diseases.
“Moreover, I hope to transfer the new knowledge that I learnt to my students and colleagues for achieving this point I am joining different events to be always updated,” she says.
Family has played an important role in Zakham’s career, particularly when she is in need of emotional and financial support.
""My biggest goal is to help my daughter to realize her dreams and become independent,"" Zakham says.
Currently, female scientists are suffering in Yemen and there is a huge gender disparity in education and scientific training, she says.
In Yemen and after war, the humanitarian impact of the conflict has been catastrophic, according to Zakham. “We have different challenges public health threats. The infrastructure damage has contributed to the raise of several communicable diseases outbreaks.”
Fighting against malnutrition in Yemen is an absolute challenge, she adds.

女性柔弱的外表下，蘊涵著堅忍，不向命運低頭的韌性！女科學家Fathiah Zakham博士，來自戰亂動盪、基礎設施大肆毀壞、公共衛生受到嚴厲挑戰的國家--葉門，雖然處在嚴苛環境，但她並未放棄醫療衛生等科學研究，相反的更加用心，希望藉由科學的力量滅絕傳染病，減輕鋒火中民眾生存的壓力。
Fathiah Zakham博士，珍惜Gro Brundtland Award的榮譽、鼓勵與機會；她說，得獎帶給她持續前進的動力，獎項讓她來到台灣與世界各地其他的科學家建立連結，帶來國際合作的可能，這個獎對她來說意義重大。
為了來台灣參加2017女性永續發展科學週，她克服了外人難以想像的交通難題。葉門長年戰爭，交通柔腸寸斷、航班不定，她訂了兩次才終於確定機位，而且為能順利成行，她刻意挑選遠赴二線城市搭機，先火車再飛機，先飛杜拜、再轉機來台，行程一波數折，這趟行程花她將近7天的時間，但是值得的。
Fathiah Zakham博士，專業領域為微生物學暨分子生物學，現為葉門Hodeidah University助理教授。現階段的她，致力於傳染病防治相關研究，包括肺結核、細菌耐藥性、出血性病毒等。
Fathiah Zakham博士認為，科學是人類的力量，人類若想在地球永續生存，應該好好發展科學，藉由科學改善困境與壓力；以處於戰亂的葉門來說，基礎設施嚴重毀壞，不利環境衛生，容易爆發傳染病，戰爭也造成民生物資缺乏、人民營養不良等問題，都是公共衛生的大挑戰。她希望透過科學打擊傳染病，降低公眾健康的威脅，還要將科學研究的新知識，傳遞給年輕一輩。
葉門是保守的國家，女性在很多方面都受到限制，社會對於女性期望不高，女性在教育、科學人才培育上的資源都遠低於男性；Fathiah Zakham博士是葉門少有的女性高知識份子，她感謝家人給予無盡的支持，才有今天的自己。
她期許更多女性可以接受良好教育，為國家社會帶來貢獻，有一個女兒的她，人生另一個期盼，就是希望女兒也能受到良好的教育，能夠獨立去追尋夢想。她也鼓勵所有想投入科學職涯的年輕人，保持動力，努力工作，永不放棄。她說，如果我們有什麼目標，認真去做，一切都有可能力。

In a released statement, NCKU said that the school's president represented Taiwan in the cross-regional online conference after she was invited to explain the pandemic prevention measures the island nation has adopted. The university said several Asian countries participated in the meeting, including Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia, India, and Malaysia.
Su emphasized that scientific research and humanitarian considerations are equally important in deciding what measures an educational institution should take to balance the teaching and safety of its students. She said the Taiwanese government has introduced necessary policies and guidelines in advance so as to give the schools sufficient time to prepare.
To the surprise of the participating countries, Su noted that although the NCKU had postponed the opening of its spring semester by two weeks, a single class has not been suspended since then. She also pointed out that most students in Taiwan have still been able to receive high-quality education at school facilities, with few classes being moved online.
The NCKU president said a nation's performance at pandemic prevention is determined by whether each citizen has fulfilled their responsibility. She added that the coronavirus could be beaten so long as countries join forces and collaborate, reported UDN.
According to NCKU, there are currently more than 1.8 billion students worldwide who have been forced to discontinue their studies due to the pandemic. As of Wednesday afternoon (May 13), the global coronavirus death toll has surpassed 292,800 while more than 4 million have been infected with the disease.
COVID-19全球大流行，嚴重衝擊世界各國高等教育，台灣是少數防疫有成且仍維持校園正常授課的國家，受到全球矚目。聯合國體系下的世界銀行（World Bank）5月12日舉辦跨區域國際視訊會議，邀請東亞國家分享疫情期間教育相關措施，幫助印度在嚴峻疫情中仍能維繫其公共教育體系。成大蘇慧貞校長受邀代表台灣出席並以專題演講分享台灣成功經驗。她在演講中暢談台灣如何在疫情爆發初期，即採取超前及審慎措施，以確保積極防疫的同時仍能維持高等教育的延續與品質；蘇校長也強調，科學與人道考量缺一不可，台灣以嚴謹的科學證據去規劃防疫措施並保障個人的安全及需求，才能讓每個人做好充份準備、有信心去執行防疫工作。
世界銀行對開發中國家教育援助不遺餘力，目前為止，全球有超過18億的學生因疫情無法正常學習，教育的「教」與「學」兩端受到前所未有挑戰，人才培育中斷，急需要採取措施因應，建立起具韌性的教育力。世界銀行舉辦視訊論壇，一方面協助印度教育迅速建立起更好的適應能力，同時也促進東亞等國家交流分享疫情下的教育政策與關鍵措施。
成大在疫情初期，即率先延後兩週開學，以備妥防疫措施並避免春節歸來後校園群聚感染的風險，隨後各級學校也宣布延後一週或兩週開學。出席會議的各國學者、印度官員等都很訝異，成大只延後開學兩星期卻能在短短的時間內做好防疫各項準備工作，而且學校沒有一天因疫情而停課。
蘇慧貞校長說，整體防疫過程中，每個人都扮演重要角色、也重視人道那一面，很多工作就能順利完成，例如，為防疫人員準備好完善的裝備與該有的保險，制定SOP流程，甚至提供團體支持、同儕諮詢等都能安定人心，工作自然順利完成。COVID-19讓人措手不及，至今確診人數及死亡人數仍向上攀升，但在全世界努力對抗病毒之際，人類更重要的是去思考，如何繼續向前邁進，以及從疾病中學到了什麼，與該負起的社會責任，一起打造出更好的前景。
台灣、新加坡、韓國、印尼、馬來西亞、香港等國家地區都受邀出席世界銀行視訊會議，會議時間自印度時間上午9:30至16:00（台灣時間中午12:00-18:30）。新加坡代表分享快速建立在地社區團隊合作，讓危機處理更落實並且有效率。南韓學者在會中針對後COVID-19時期，探討各國教育制度之因應以及未來可能合作的模式與方向。馬來西亞代表在會中與與會者交流，如何強化遠距學習之數位內容及有效性。

17,partnership-for-the-goals,"Taiwan’s NCKU, German university mark 1 year of Asia office","Tainan's National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) and Germany's Technische Universität Darmstadt (TUDa) on Thursday (May 7) joined together in a two-day event celebrating the first anniversary of the TUDa Asia Office at NCKU.
On Thursday, NCKU and TUDa teamed up with German engineering company Bosch to organize a workshop in which to discuss future student exchanges and study programs that would provide students from both universities with internship opportunities at Bosch-Taipei. The universities also planned future scientific endeavors.
NCKU President Dr. Huey-Jen Jenny Su (蘇慧貞) stated that the NCKU-TUDa-Bosch partnership allows students to do internships and participate in business projects in a world-class company. This program acts as a cornerstone for the two nation's talent and leadership cultivation, she added.
Dr. Su went on to say that professors from both schools, which specialize in mechanical and chemical engineering and materials science, would be able to devote their time and effort towards scientific research through this trilateral collaboration.
On Friday, NCKU, TUDa, and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) together explored future cooperative prospects, faculty research funding plans, and study abroad opportunities. TUDa exchange students also shared their experiences at NCKU with their local counterparts.
NCKU has forged a strong link with Germany, having signed 41 agreements with 14 German universities, enabling international student exchanges, short-term research and internships, academic visits, and dual-degree programs. The opening of TUDa's NCKU Asia Office in May 2019 was aimed at strengthening bilateral university relations, increasing project collaboration, and solidifying the Taiwanese institution's goal of international education and cooperation.
Su pointed out that the inauguration of TUDa's Asia Office marked the first time a German university had established an office in Taiwan.
The two schools have collaborated in numerous multifaceted research projects, Professor Hsiao-Wen Wang (王筱雯), NCKU's vice president for international affairs, stated. Wang also mentioned that the addition of a member from TUDa's International Relations and Mobility unit at NCKU could provide direct and accessible individual consultation for overseas study and research in Germany.
In addition, a short-term course in materials science was recently developed by a TUDa professor, Wang said.
According to Wang, the German university chose to send five exchange students to NCKU due to the Tainan university's highly regarded learning environment and Taiwan's successful epidemic prevention efforts amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Both parties are excited about what the German university's Asia office will bring. Claudia Finner, director of the office, praised NCKU for its research foundation, pragmatic spirit, and unwavering dedication to issues of tomorrow, while Dr. Su said he looks forward to celebrating many more anniversaries with TUDa and hopes Germany will nurture a closer relationship with Taiwan.
NCKU and TUDa signed their first academic cooperation agreement in 1987 and have since promoted faculty mobility and student exchanges as well as created a link between the Taiwan Comprehensive University System (TCUS) and TU9 German Institutes of Technology. Over 30 years of mutual understanding and cooperation, the two schools earned the recognition of the EU's Erasmus Program in 2017, heralding a bright future for years to come.

成功大學與德國達姆施塔特工業大學（TU Darmstadt）共同慶祝達姆工大亞洲辦公室設立於成大校園滿一週年，舉辦為期兩天的慶祝活動，包含5月7日成大-達姆工大-台灣博世（Bosch）三方研討會，規劃未來學生交換計畫、德國企業實習暨獎學金之學程結合規劃，激盪學術研究與產業應用可能，5月8日成大-達姆工大-臺北德國學術交流資訊中心（DAAD）講座與交流會，探討台德共同科學研究機會與計畫，獎學金與研究補助說明，達姆工大學生更分享至成大就讀的學習與生活經驗。不僅僅回顧兩校30餘年的長遠交流，慶祝近一年亞洲辦公室的緊密合作，更在活動中紮實推動未來計畫，呈現成大穩扎穩打的國際交流作法。
成功大學蘇慧貞校長表示，成大已經與14所德國大學簽署共計41份合約，其中與達姆工大合作籌辦設立在成大校園的達姆工大亞洲辦公室，為台灣首次有德國大學設立辦公室據點，成立至今，除了兩校更加頻繁互動，更由點對點交流拓展為多方夥伴架構。例如成大-達姆工大-台灣博世三方合作架構下，讓成大學生有更多機會攻讀台德課程，同時得以進入國際級企業實習執行專案，豐富學習歷程與厚實未來職涯基礎，為兩國培養未來領袖人才；此外，兩校機械工程、化學工程領域教授與博世進行產學合作，於大工程領域投入科學研發量能，鏈結企業脈動與需求。
蘇校長指出，成大的國際教育核心著眼於培植學生國際移動力與適應力，同時強調將學術研究運用於人類真正需求、提升整體社會發展。也因為全校同心秉持著以上宗旨，長期依聯合國永續發展目標來評估大學全球績效，於4月22日公布之2020年英國泰晤士高等教育（THE）世界大學影響力排名（Impact Rankings），成功大學排名全台最高，亞洲第二，全球第38名。而達姆工大除了是成大重要的老朋友，更是志同道合的好夥伴，擁抱相同價值理念，也因此共同規劃或執行專案時相當有默契，相信未來將能夠攜手迎接許多周年慶典，齊為台德未來注入心力。
成大國際長王筱雯教授表示，達姆工大與成大已經發展豐富多元合作模式。開辦德國語文與文化密集班，課程中融合簡介德國職場、高等教育、生活文化差異，加強學生與教職員語言能力以外，更培養國際適應力。達姆工大人員進駐成大校園辦公，直接提供赴德學習或學術研究之個別諮詢，並且加入職涯通識教育以及外文課程設計一環，達姆工大材料領域師資亦到成大開授短期課程。雙邊交流之外，亦推動多邊計畫，例如與博世、臺北德國學術交流資訊中心刻正進行的合作，以及預計未來達姆工大加入成大馬越泰海外基地專案。同時，成大就學環境以及台灣防疫表現皆獲得達姆工大高度肯定信賴，因此在疫情期間，達姆工大選擇將5名德國籍赴外交換生送到成大就讀。
達姆工大亞洲辦公室主任Claudia Finner，曾經服務於新加坡、韓國等地學術機構，稱讚成大擁有優秀的研究基礎、高度實務精神、始終致力於未來議題之理念。達姆工大今年到機械工程系進行交換課程的女同學Elvira Khamenok，相當開心來到台灣學習，熱情地述說著台灣友好熱心的人、有趣的文化、美味的食物和令人嘆為觀止的美麗風景。另一位交換到資訊科學系的男同學Jens Grünwald，感謝成大協助及接受因為疫情緣故臨時更改就讀學校的他，以及所有伸出友善雙手的台灣人，同時稱讚台灣值得探索的美景，他表示以後一定推薦朋友們到成大就讀或交換。
成大與德國達姆工大於1987年首次簽署學術合作協議書，陸續開啟教研人員交流、學生交換計畫，積極促成臺灣綜合大學系統與德國理工大學九校聯盟互訪合作，建基於逾30年之良好默契，兩校於2017年成功爭取到歐盟伊拉斯謨計劃（Erasmus Programme），達姆工大更於2019年5月將其亞洲辦公室設立於成大校園。成大至今與14所德國大學簽署共41份合約，進行交換學生、短期研究與實習、學術訪問、跨國雙學位等計畫。由於德國向來以工程研究實力見長，成大在工程領域表現亦相當傑出，因此成大與德國於大工程領域之雙邊協議專案型國際合作研究計畫相當多，包含能源及材料領域等。

17,partnership-for-the-goals,NCKU joined RISESat Microsatellite Project with Japan,"After 7 years of hard work and perseverance, microsatellite mission RISESat, which is directed by Tohoku University of Japan and which NCKU is a participant of, successfully launched their Epsilon rocket from Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) on January 18 at 8:50 AM, GMT +8. Professor Bing-Chih Chen, chairman of the Institute of Space and Plasma Sciences, Professor Charles Lin of the Department of Earth Sciences, and other teachers and students joined NCKU president Dr. Huey-Jen Jenny Su in witnessing this historical event. RISESat made contact with ground stations at 7:00 PM, GMT +8 that night, and preliminary checks show that satellite status is normal.
In the coming weeks, once the ground station in Japan completes various secondary system inspections, scientific experiments spanning two years will commence. The NCKU research team will direct airglow and upper-atmospheric lightning observation and study space weather and the cycle of atmospheric electricity. Their goal is to understand the relationship between lightning and extreme weather, which is having an increasingly severe impact on human life, and the influence of changes in the space environment on space communication.
Professor Bing-Chih Chen’s research team was invited to join Tohoku University’s RISESat microsatellite project in 2011. They developed the Dual-Band Optical Transient Camera (DOTCam), a space optical camera that will enable the observation of space environment elements such as airglow and upper-atmospheric lightning once the satellite enters orbit. Relevant basic scientific research will be applicable to space weather-related research. Originally planned to be launched in 2013, the microsatellite was unexpectedly delayed. Professor Bing-Chih Chen emphasized that it would normally have taken 18 months for the NCKU research team to complete their part after the restart of the project, but they worked hard and finished in nine months to meet the launch schedule .
Professor Bing-Chih Chen stated that NCKU’s participation in the RISESat project demonstrates that NCKU’s space instrument R&D capabilities have reached international standards. Their performance will open up more opportunities for international collaboration, effectively enhance Taiwan’s manufacturing technologies and international visibility, and assist manufacturers in penetrating the international space industry.
The RISESat microsatellite is only 50 cm3 and 59.3 kg. To fit inside this miniature satellite, the NCKU research team successfully developed a fully-featured, compact space optical camera that weighs only 710 g. New lossless compression technology will substantially reduce data storage space and transmission time. Considering the necessity of advanced technologies taking root in the industry, they insisted that all key components be manufactured in Taiwan. The core circuit board of the camera was made with great help from Taiwan’s leading aerospace company, the Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC).
When Tohoku University invited Professor Bing-Chih Chen’s research team to participate in the RISESat microsatellite project in 2011, they joined seven teams from five other countries (Japan, Czech Republic, Hungary, Sweden, and Indonesia ). However, unforeseen issues on the Japanese side interrupted the original schedule, and the project was not restarted until March, 2017. Fortunately, the successful launch occurred under two years later, to the credit of all participating teams and their countries.
經過 7 年的努力與堅持，成功大學參與日本東北大學領軍的微衛星 RISESAT 任務，1 月 18 日台灣時間上午 8：50 分從日本宇航局（JAXA）的 Epsilon 火箭成功發射升空，成大蘇慧貞校長帶領電漿所陳炳志所長、地科系林建宏教授、工程師劉偉台等師生在現場見證歷史。RISESAT 已於台灣時間晚上7點與地面站順利接觸，初步確認衛星狀態正常。
陳炳志指出，未來數週，待日本地面站逐步完成RISESAT的各項次級系統檢查，就會開啟為期2年的科學實驗任務，成大團隊主導大氣輝光與高空閃電的觀測，進行大氣電循環與太空天氣領域研究，瞭解影響人類生活越來越劇烈的極端氣候與閃電的關係，及太空環境變化對於導航與太空通訊的影響。
陳炳志說，微衛星火箭發射，日本產官學研界與近千名民眾參與，也有其他亞洲國家團隊，因共同參與其他升空的衛星任務而來見證，成大團隊積極與現場國際太空相關人士交流，介紹成大在太空領域從科學到工程項目的完整發展，期待在已有的基礎上，透過國際合作在太空任務中扮演重要角色。目前，亞洲國家，如 GDP 不及於台灣的越南都積極投入太空領域的發展，台灣也應該能在政府強力支持下，結合產學研力量有積極表現。
RISESAT 為國際合作的科學任務，原預定 2013 年發射，因故延遲至今。18 日上午衛星發射、順利入軌，完成最後一哩路，參與的團隊都極其興奮。

17,partnership-for-the-goals,Worldwide Universities Network Executive Director Prof. Peter Lennie Visits NCKU,"National Cheng Kung University is the only university in Taiwan to have joined the Worldwide Universities Network (WUN). Soon after taking his post as the new executive director of the WUN in August, 2018, Prof. Peter Lennie arrived at NCKU to get a more in-depth understanding of NCKU’s current and prospective research projects in September, 2018. During his visit, NCKU and WUN took their partnership to the next level in a roundtable meeting where NCKU President Dr. Huey-Jen Su underscored the university’s full support for all the research projects, conferences, and events under the WUN, and encouraged members at all levels of the university to be proactive in coming up with research projects and becoming more active in the WUN. Professor Peter Lennie added that student research projects and scholar exchange programs would be further expanded and subsidized in the future.
The Worldwide Universities Network is a global higher education alliance comprised of 23 research-intensive universities across 13 countries and 6 continents. The universities in the WUN work in concerted effort to address four major challenges brought on by global development, such as climate change, public health, higher education and research, and cultural awareness. National Cheng Kung University joined the network in 2016. A diverse team of eleven researchers, including Professor Su-lin Yu from the NCKU Center for Gender & Women Studies and others from Hong Kong, Macau, and Japan, worked together on the “Marriage Migrants in Asia” project, which was recognized by the WUN as one of the top 14 most influential research projects in 2018.
The roundtable meeting was attended by NCKU President Dr. Huey-Jen Su, the WUN Executive Director Professor Peter Lennie as well as other NCKU officials such as NCKU Vice President Tungyang Chen, Vice President and Associate Vice President of the NCKU Office of R&D Sun-Yuan Hsieh and Pei-Jung Lu, and the Associate Vice President of NCKU Office of International Affairs Chia-Yuan Chen.

17,partnership-for-the-goals,"Studying Abroad at NCKU, Vietnamese Students Participate in Cultural Exchange","In recent years, Taiwan has formed close relationships with many countries in Southeast Asia, and many students from Vietnam, a country with a diverse culture, have chosen to study in Taiwan. With its strong international ranking, convenient location, and hospitable environment, as well as the official establishment of the Center for Vietnamese Studies in 2013, NCKU has become the preferred school for many Vietnamese Students. Nogc Thuy Vi Pham, Trang Trinh Thuy, and Thi Nga Do all chose to pursue their doctoral degrees at NCKU. In addition to their academic achievements, each of them has also made contributions to fostering cultural exchange between Taiwan and Vietnam.
There are currently around 200 Vietnamese students enrolled at NCKU, scattered throughout various departments. For the past twelve years, the Vietnamese Student Association has hosted a range of activities for the university’s annual cultural week. The students spend at least six months preparing for these activities with the aim of spreading understanding of Vietnamese history, traditions, and current socio-cultural climate. Nogc Thuy Vi Pham, who is pursuing her PhD at the Department of Taiwanese Literature in NCKU, once served as the president of the Vietnamese Student Association. She proudly shared, “Over the years, interactions between Taiwanese and Vietnamese students have become closer and friendlier.”
Ngoc Thuy Vi Pham acts as a teaching assistant for the Vietnamese language courses offered at NCKU, and holds the post of Vietnamese language lecturer at Chang Jung Christian University and Chung Hwa University of Medical Technology. She often brings Vietnamese dishes that she cooks herself to her classes as a way of introducing Vietnamese culture. She emphasized that misunderstanding can arise from cultural differences. For example, balut (fertilized duck eggs) is a Vietnamese specialty which can seem strange to other cultures. She therefore made balut for her students to try. “It’s funny to see, because many students were afraid to crack open the shell at first, but once they got a taste, they quickly came back for seconds.”
Ngoc Thuy Vi Pham explained that Vietnam is a diverse country made up of 54 ethnic groups. While there are many similarities between the cultures in Taiwan and Vietnam, they also have their own unique features. "" The Center for Vietnamese Studies holds the largest seminar event in Taiwan every three years and invites over a hundred scholars from around the world to present their achievements. The Center for Vietnamese Studies began offering an undergraduate credit course last year due to the increasing opportunities and demand for Vietnamese speakers.”
Trang Trinh Thuy, who has been in Taiwan for six years, comes from North Vietnam. She has a master’s degree in Taiwanese literature and is currently pursuing a PhD in Chinese literature at NCKU. “Taiwanese food is similar to South Vietnamese food. North Vietnamese food is lighter in flavor with little oil or salt. In Vietnam, banh pho is generally accompanied by a large plate of raw vegetables as garnishes as well as many lemon slices.” While unused to the food, she can speak Mandarin as fluently as any Taiwanese person. She loves the friendliness and passion of Taiwanese people and is fascinated by Taiwanese literature.
Trang Trinh Thuy was born in North Vietnam but later lived in South Vietnam, so she is familiar with different aspects of Vietnamese culture. She excels at helping corporations in Taiwan resolve internal conflicts with their Vietnamese employees. She feels fortunate that she heeded her teacher’s advice to study in Taiwan, which has been an eye-opening experience for her. “If I had not come to Taiwan, I would never have learnt the extent of my capabilities. I have become stronger and more independent and confident during my time here.”
Thi Nga Do, who has a cheerful disposition, obtained her master’s degree and PhD in physics from NCKU. Last year, she married a fellow grad student and became a foreign bride in Taiwan. She can communicate with her father- and mother-in-law in simple Taiwanese. She is fluent in Mandarin, English, and Vietnamese and is currently preparing to apply to Ministry of Science and Technology for an overseas research project. She hopes to further her studies in the United States and pursue an academic career in Taiwan. A few days ago, she was invited to serve as a cultural ambassador for the National Immigration Agency.
Thi Nga Do said, “Taiwan is very clean, and life is convenient here. I like Taiwan very much, and I have really enjoyed living and studying here.” During her time in Taiwan, Thi Hga Do has done what she can to give back to the community that has welcomed her. She was in charge of making banh mi, which is Vietnamese bread, for a charity bake sale held by the Vietnamese Student Association at NCKU, and she helped an injured Vietnamese student in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics to raise funds to cover his medical expenses.
These foreigners have actively explored Taiwan, brought with them their language, art, and food cultures, and even put down roots. They think of Taiwan as their second home. As Ngoc Thuy Vi Pham said, “Cultural exchange is a crucial factor of mutual understanding between different ethnic groups. With understanding, we can accept and respect one another.”
近年來台灣與東南亞國家關係密切，擁有多元文化的越南也有許多優秀學子選擇到台灣留學，成功大學在國際間表現亮眼，加上生活交通便利、人情濃厚，更早在2013年就正式成立越南研究中心，成為越南學生首選。范玉翠薇、鄭垂莊、杜氏娥有志一同選擇在成大攻讀博士學位，這幾位高知識份子除了勤奮求學，也為台越的文化交流貢獻己力。
每年在成大留學的越南學生將近200人，分散在各個系所，為了凝聚情感，也為了傳遞越南傳統文化、歷史與現代社會情況，讓更多台灣人了解越南並喜歡越南，越南學生會每年花費半年時間籌辦文化週活動，至今已持續12屆。目前在成大台灣文學所攻讀博士的范玉翠薇，曾任越南學生會會長，她欣喜分享，「幾年下來，台越學生的互動更加友善緊密」。
范玉翠薇在成大擔任越南語課程助教，也在長榮、中華醫事大學擔任越南語講師，常親自料理越南菜帶到課堂上，藉由飲食介紹越南文化。她強調，很多誤解其實來自於文化上的差異，例如越南人常吃鴨仔蛋補身體，給人殘忍恐怖的印象，於是范玉翠薇準備了鴨仔蛋讓學生嘗試，「有趣的是，很多學生起先害怕的敲開蛋殼勉強嚐了一小口，很快就想要再來一顆」。
范玉翠薇認為，越南是個擁有54個民族的多元國家，而台越文化有很多相似，也各有獨特之處，各方面都可深入交流。「學術方面，成大越南研究中心每3年舉辦全國最大規模的研討盛會，邀請來自全世界各國逾百位學者參與發表；語言方面，基於台灣人使用越南語的機會與需求越?越高，去年開始開辦越南語文學士學分班，培養具備使用越南語能?的人才」，都是很好的交流機會。
來台灣6年的鄭垂莊，是北越人，拿了成大台灣文學碩士，又攻讀成大中文博士，「台灣口味和南越較為相似，北越口味則較清淡，少油少鹽，在越南吃河粉會搭配一大盤提味用的生菜以及許多檸檬片」，在飲食上不太能適應的她，流利的中文卻一點都不輸給台灣人，喜歡台灣人的友善熱情，還特別喜歡台灣文學，甚至想把台灣文學的精髓發揚光大。
談起台灣文學眼神就發亮的鄭垂莊說，以前只認識中國文學，不知道有台灣文學而且還這麼有趣！雖然只有400多年歷史，但有太多新的主題可以鑽研發揮，現在已經有葉石濤作品的翻譯本引入越南，「對越南而言，是建構國際世界文學史觀非常重要的區塊」。
出生在北越的鄭垂莊後來在南越生活多年，因此了解各地越南人的不同習性，擅於為台灣許多企業解決越籍勞工的各種問題，她慶幸當時聽從師長建議到台灣留學，讓她眼界大開，「如果不是來到台灣，不會知道自己可以做這麼多事情，個性上也變得更加獨立、堅強、有自信。」她期待自己能成為台灣文學的頂尖學者，把台灣美好文化帶回家鄉，影響越南。
取得成大物理系碩士、博士的杜氏娥，個性活潑開朗，去年嫁給博士班同學，成為台灣媳婦，還可以用簡單的台語和公婆溝通。她表現傑出並精通中、英、越3種語言，目前已準備向科技部申請海外研究計畫，希望前往美國深造再返回台灣從事學術工作，日前更獲邀擔任移民署多元文化大使。
杜氏娥說，「台灣乾淨又便利，我很喜歡台灣，在台灣念書、生活都很開心」。很有愛心的她，經常在能力所及內捐款助人，曾為成大越南學生會發起的義賣活動負責製作越南麵包，幫助當時受傷的航太系越南籍學生籌措龐大醫療費。
熱愛料理的杜氏娥，喜歡台灣人的友善，佩服同學會玩又會念書，從研究所開始就常邀約台灣同學料理共餐，互相分享家鄉味，她會因應同學的喜好變化口味，而餐桌上的交流，也許是課業心得的分享、也許是某件事的共識，也或許是文化觀念的互相理解。
這些異鄉人積極探索台灣，也輸入母國的語言、藝術、飲食等文化，甚至落地生根，她們把台灣當作第二個家，范玉翠薇相信，「文化交流是不同族群相互理解的重要因素，透過理解就能互相尊重包容」。

17,partnership-for-the-goals,NCKU Lifts the Veil of Islam and Creates First Muslim-Friendly Campus,"Discrimination and Bias Are Everywhere, But Faith Makes the Heart Strong
In the three years since the foundation of the Muslim Students Association (MSA) at NCKU, exchange and communication with Muslim students around the world has proliferated. The opening of the prayer room in 2016 was considered a major milestone. For many Taiwanese people, Islam has always been a mysterious and even fearsome religion. However, our in-depth talks with Muslim students revealed that these foreign students, who strictly adhere to their doctrines, find strength in their faith. Born in societies governed by Islamic law, they were shocked when they travelled abroad and saw the misleading impressions caused by the media about their faith. This has prompted their determination to spread understanding of their religion.
“Becoming a Muslim Was the Result of Contemplation and Rational Analysis; Islam Is the Best Training for Purifying One’s Mind and Body”
Several Muslim students pointed out that their devoutness was not because the families they were born in follow the Islamic faith. Rather, they chose to be Muslims after deep contemplation and rational analysis once they reached adulthood. Issa, a Muslim student who has been in Taiwan for three years and is pursuing his PhD in clinical medicine at NCKU, explained that his mother is a Christian and his father is Muslim. He experienced both religions growing up. In the end, he chose Islam. “Islam has strict doctrines, but if you think about them carefully, you will realize that their purpose is to make you stronger. For example, alcohol is bad for the body and causes illnesses. We abstain from drinking to keep our bodies strong.” Leaving their homes to live in a non-Islamic country, Muslim students must face various inconveniences brought by their adherence to their religion, such as praying five times a day. This serves as a test of their perseverance and ability to resist temptation. Islam can help train its followers to purify their minds and bodies.
However, stereotypes and discrimination are commonplace. Nursing student Dewi shared something that happened to another Muslim student at NCKU when she was out shopping. A multiracial couple entered the store with their daughter not long after she did. The little girl was so adorable that the female Muslim student gave her a small wave and a smile. To her dismay, the Caucasian father of the girl said to her, “What a fxxking terrorist!” The female Muslim student was so shocked that she did not know how to respond and cried all the way back to her dorm. Dewi said, “We can feel how friendly Taiwanese people are to us. We had no idea that we would meet such discrimination in Taiwan or that it would come from someone who was also a foreigner to Taiwan.” Rizki, a Muslim student studying for his PhD in politics at the College of Social Sciences, said emotionally, “This is what real terrorism looks like; it’s a terrorist attack on the mind.”
The Founding Purpose and Mission of MSA Is To Teach More People about Islam
The purpose of the MSA is to ensure and protect the rights and safety of Muslims in Taiwan and to spread awareness and understanding of Islam. The NCKU Student Union began collaborating with National Tainan Chia-Chi Senior High School and De Guang Catholic Comprehensive High School this year, arranging classes to give younger Taiwanese a deeper understanding of Islam. MSA president Faizal said, “We also held a halaal cooking contest with these high-school students this April to see what they learned from these classes.” They undertake this kind of activism not as missionary work, but rather to offer information on Islam, and step by step, clear up the widespread misunderstandings associated with their religion.
Faizal, who will graduate and return to Indonesia this year, introduced us to Theo, and said that he would be the next president of the student union. Theo laughed and humbly denied this, but the gleam in his eyes showed us that these Muslim students, who are strong in their hearts due to their faith, are devoted to promoting understanding of Islam in Taiwan and that this spirit and sense of purpose will continue to prosper.
成大穆斯林學生會成立3年多來，成功促進了來自各國的穆斯林學生交流與聯繫。2016年啟用的祈禱室，更被視為一大成就。伊斯蘭教對許多台灣人來說，總是帶點神祕，又感到些許戒慎恐懼的宗教。深入與穆斯林交談，會發現這群對自身信仰嚴守教規的外籍學生，內心的堅毅比許多人都來得強大。一出生便在伊斯蘭教的規範下成長的他們，來到國外後遭受了文化衝擊，以及因媒體而起對他們的信仰有偏頗印象，但相反地，更激起他們想讓更多人認識伊斯蘭教的決心。
信奉伊斯蘭教經過思考理性分析　洗滌身心靈最佳鍛鍊
虔誠卻不因原生家庭信奉伊斯蘭教而盲從，幾個學生都紛紛指出他們在成長過程中都是經過思考並且理性分析過後才選擇成為穆斯林的。已來台3年，在成大臨床醫學研究所攻讀博士學位，來自奈及利亞的Issa說他的母親是基督徒，從小他便接觸了兩個宗教，最後他選擇了伊斯蘭教，「伊斯蘭教規嚴謹，但仔細思考，這些規定其實是在使我們變得更好更強。例如，酒精對人體不好，會引起疾病，我們不喝是在保持自身強壯的體魄。」而離鄉背井，在非伊斯蘭教國家生活的他們，面對謹守教規的所帶來的種種不便，以及如何堅持奉行一天5次的祈禱，也是對內在拒絕誘惑以及毅力的嚴格訓鍊，伊斯蘭教規就是一種洗滌身心靈的最佳鍛鍊。
然而，刻板印象與歧見在世界上仍無所不在，就讀護理系的Dewi分享了同是成大穆斯林學生的經歷。穆斯林女學生到店裡購物，不久店內走進了一對帶著一個混血兒小孩的國際夫妻，丈夫是來自西方國家的臉孔。孩童的稚嫩可愛讓這位穆斯林女同學忍不住與他互動，對他笑了笑，沒想到他那不知來自哪個國家的父親，竟然就對著她說：「What a fxxking terrorist！（哪裡來他媽的恐怖份子！）」這位女同學嚇得不知如何應答，一路哭著回到宿舍。Dewi說：「我們感受得到台灣人對我們的友善，沒想到在台灣遭受到歧視，竟然是同樣來自國外的外籍人士。」正攻讀社會學院政治系博士學位的Rizki也有感而發：「這才是恐攻，心靈上的恐怖攻擊。」
MSA成立的宗旨與使命　讓更多人認識伊斯蘭教
MSA成立的宗旨，就是希望能夠確保及維護在台穆斯林的權益和安全，並使人們不再對穆斯林感到害怕。因此，學生會在今年度也開始與家齊女中以及德光女中合作，安排講師到學校授課，目的是希望更多的年輕學子能夠對伊斯蘭教泯除偏見，深入認識該宗教。MSA會長Faizal說：「今年4月我們還為這些高中生舉辦了Halal Food的烹飪比賽，驗收上課成果。」不求這些年輕孩子一定要成為穆斯林的兄弟姊妹，但至少可以讓更多人認識伊斯蘭教，一步一步慢慢走，化開外界對此宗教的誤解。
而5月中旬至6月中適逢齋戒月，創各大學校園之先例，成功大學學務處活動發展組於6月6、7日舉行「國立成功大學2018年伊斯蘭校園高峰會」 （NCKU World Islam Campus Summit 2018），為營造一個更為理解、尊重、接納和友善的大學校園而努力。活動中除了邀多位國內外大學校長、貴賓、學者專家、學生，齊聚一堂，進行中英文對談之外，也安排播放數部伊斯蘭電影並部分開放映後座談。穆斯林學生協會MSA在高峰會也擔任重要角色，除了論壇主題的發想與資訊提供外，也擔任接待外賓的工作，以及派出代表參與論壇，分享個人經驗。學生會的活躍、積極，以及與對自身宗教的虔誠與熱情由此可見一斑。
Faizal今年即將畢業回到印尼，他特別介紹在座的另一位學生Theo將是下一位學生會會長，雖然Theo謙虛地笑著否認，但眼神卻透露著光彩，也顯示出這一群因宗教而內心剛強的穆斯林學生們，願意為在台灣穆斯林付出的使命與精神，將會一屆一屆地傳承下去。

17,partnership-for-the-goals,Muslim Students Association – NCKU Makes Major Step for Muslims Living in Taiwan,"NCKU Lifts the Veil of Islam and Creates First Muslim-friendly Campus
An increasing number of foreign students enroll at NCKU every year, and many of them are followers of Islam. At present, there are approximately 200 Muslim students at NCKU from places around the world, including Iran, Egypt, Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and even Burkina Faso in West Africa. In response to this growing trend, in 2014 the Muslim Students Association-NCKU (MSA) was founded.
Current MSA president Faizal states that the MSA operates not only to serve its student members but also to promote interactions and exchanges with international Muslim organizations and to provide assistance to Muslims staying in Taiwan for short or long periods of time. For example, the MSA has provided Muslim businessmen with a venue for their ritual prayers. The five Muslim students that we interviewed all agreed that the prayer room established at NCKU in 2016 was a great advantage for Muslims living in Taiwan.
Taiwanese Friendliness Makes Muslims in Taiwan Feel at Ease
When it comes to Islam, there is a lot of curiosity from the Taiwanese public. The garments of a Muslim woman walking the sunny streets of Tainan in summer will especially draw attention. NCKU nursing student Dewi remarked that students are often curious about her clothes, asking why she has cloaks in so many colors and styles, and some even ask to try them on. She has been asked whether she is envious of the less-concealing clothes worn by other female students. To this, she replied, “I’m used to this style of dress, so I don’t feel envious or uncomfortable, but these are questions that I would never get in my own country, so I find talking about it really interesting!”
Another troublesome matter for Muslims living in Taiwan is food. Muslims are prohibited from eating pork, and even the cookware used to cook their food must never have been used to cook pork. As a result, many Muslim students choose to cook their own meals, but this is difficult for Muslim students who live in a dorm with no access to a kitchen. Few restaurants offer halal food in Tainan. However, the friendliness of Taiwanese people and their respect for the religions of others have gratified these Muslim students. Faizal said, ""The restaurants in Taiwan are all very friendly. They’re always willing to prepare our orders separately and as we request them.”
Issa, who has been living in Taiwan for 3 years, shared her observations of the friendly treatment that Taiwanese people give to Muslims: “I have some friends who study in Northern Taiwan. Because they do not have a prayer room like we do here at NCKU, they perform their ritual prayers in the dormitory hall. However, they are never asked to leave or given strange looks. Instead, the other students try not to disturb them, which makes them feel at ease.”
Living Abroad Helps Muslims Gain a Broader Perspective
There is a widespread impression of Muslims as serious, dignified, and disciplined, but after meeting and talking with them, we were quick to realize that they can also be free and lively. When asked whether they envy the freedom of Taiwanese youth to socialize and enjoy themselves all five laughed. Issa said, “You can ask anyone in our department; everyone knows me! I am very boisterous and love chatting with people!”
When we asked after their impressions of the Taiwanese, Dewi laughed. When she first arrived in Taiwan, she often saw senior citizens nagging and harping on about things loudly in public. Their yelling and scolding made her think that all elderly people in Taiwan had bad tempers. It wasn't until later that she realized they were talking loudly but not in anger.
These foreign students have since graduated and returned to contribute to their hometowns and countries, but the kindness and acceptance of the Taiwanese have long made them think of Taiwan as their second home. Cultural differences are part of living in and exploring the world. It takes personal experience for people to be able to let go of and laugh over differences between individuals, races, and cultures. We hope that the broadened perspective gained by these students will continue to grow and serve them.
近年來，台南古都日趨飄著國際味。校區遍佈台南市區的成功大學，外籍學生人數也年年成長，其中有相當多的同學信奉伊斯蘭教。這群信奉伊斯蘭教的外籍學生來自世界各地，因此成大在2014年組成穆斯林學生會（Muslim Students Association-NCKU，簡稱MSA） 。目前穆斯林學生數約200人，其中以來自印尼的居多，另也有來自伊朗、埃及、奈及利亞、印度、巴基斯坦、孟加拉、斯里蘭卡、馬來西亞等國家，甚至有來自西非布吉納法索的學生，相當國際化。
MSA現任會長Faizal表示，成大穆斯林學生會的運行，不是只為這200多位外籍學生服務而已，他們也透過網路與海外國際穆斯林組織互動，促進交流，並和長期或短期在台灣停留的穆斯林們取得聯繫，適時給予協助。MSA便曾提供臨時來台南出差的穆斯林就業人士，在祈禱時間來臨時有個棲身之所進行禱告儀式。受訪的5位成大穆斯林學生代表異口同聲表示，成大在2016年成立祈禱室，對穆斯林在台灣生活來說，無疑是向前邁進一大步的重要成就。
台灣人的友善讓在台灣穆斯林感到自在
說起伊斯蘭教，民眾總有許多好奇。尤其女穆斯林的服裝穿著，炎夏艷陽下走在台南街頭，容易引人注目，投以眼光。對此，就讀成大醫學院護理系的Dewi說已經習慣了，倒是常有同學會很好奇地提問，例如問她為什麼有那麼多顏色與款式，甚至借來試穿。也會有人問她天氣這麼熱，會不會羨慕其他女同學可以穿著清涼？她回答：「真的是習慣了，所以不會感到羨慕或不自在，但這些在自己國家不會遇到的提問，真的令人覺得十分有趣！」
在台的生活，最令穆斯林感到困擾的應該就是食物了。台灣人吃豬肉的比例比起其他肉品高出許多，然而伊斯蘭教規卻不能吃豬肉，甚至烹調過程使用的鍋具必須是沒有料理過豬肉的。很多學生就選擇自己親自下廚，洗手作羹湯，但對住在宿舍，沒有廚房的穆斯林學生來說就沒那麼容易了。畢竟，台南販賣Halal Food的餐廳真的少之又少。
不過，台灣人的友善以及對他人信仰的尊重卻令這群穆斯林學生感到窩心。MSA會長Faizal就說：「在這裡最不方便的應該是飲食問題，但台灣的餐廳很友善，總是能配合我們提出的需求，特製我們可食用的餐點。」
在台已經3年的Issa也分享台灣人如何友善看待穆斯林的觀察：「我有幾位在北部大學念書的朋友，因為該校沒有像成大提供祈禱室，所以友人們祈禱時間一到，會直接在宿舍的走廊上進行禱告儀式，但他們並沒有因此遭到驅趕，行經的同學不會投以異樣的眼光，也盡量不讓自己打擾到儀式進行，讓人感到十分自在。」
穆斯林國外生活讓眼界變得更宏觀
穆斯林總帶給人們嚴肅、端莊、守紀律的形象，然而實際接觸談天，卻能感受到他們自在與活潑。問起他們是否羨慕台灣的年輕人可以隨時開心地嬉鬧、手舞足蹈，5人全都笑開了，Issa更說：「你可以去問問我們系上，沒有人不認識我耶！因為我真的太愛跟人聊天說話了！」
那麼對台灣人的印象呢﹖Dewi笑著說她剛來台灣時到店家買東西，常遇到台灣長輩在公共場合放大聲量碎念著，當時她總覺得台灣年長的人怎麼好像脾氣很壞，老是在咆哮罵人，後來才知道他們只是說話大聲了點，不是在生氣。
既然如此喜歡台灣，畢業後會不會想留在台灣？畢竟都是異鄉遊子，這幾位外籍學生都選擇學成後回國為家鄉奉獻，但台灣人的親切與接納，讓他們早已將台灣視為第二個家。穆斯林學生的分享，都是來自日常生活的真實體驗與觀察，讓人更加明白，文化的差異無所不在。總要親身經歷與感受過，才能對人與人之間，乃至於種族與文化間的落差感到釋懷、一笑置之。期許他們畢業後回到自己國家，在未來保持對世界的宏觀與開闊。

17,partnership-for-the-goals,"Industry’s First Combination of Medicine and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Furthering AI Education","For the first time, NCKU Medical Center worked with the NCKU College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science to open novel courses. Under the leadership of NCKU president, Dr. Jenny Su, more than 10 NCKU Medical Center professors and doctors worked together to open a series of courses on “AI Applications and Services in Medical Treatment”. The courses will be available in the College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science by 2019 to help students systematically learn the new frontier of medical treatment.
The key to this new frontier of medical treatment is to discover new values of AI applications. We expect students to be more open to AI applications and extend their studies. This collaboration between the Center and the College is expected to enhance the training of talents with both backgrounds in engineering and medicine to spread the seed of Taiwan's AI medical technology and speed up the realization of intelligent medical treatment. AI Applications and Services in Medical Treatment is designed for the third year students of the college, and expects clinical doctors to mentor students with engineering design capabilities and engineering background. The goal is to interpret the medical revolution utilizing AI and discover the infinite possibilities of AI medical applications.
For example, cardiac surgeons will explain to students how to efficiently analyze electronic medical records, test data, gene pools and other Big data and develop them into clinical models to assist in diagnosis and treatment decisions. Medical imaging doctors will start with practical cases and explain how AI assists in reading medical images. Oncologists will talk about how to apply the massive gene data to clinical circumstances. Neurologists will explain how to use AI to diagnose complex neuropathies.
For many years NCKU Medical Center has been collaborating with domestic and overseas world-class Big data experts to study and apply AI for medical treatment. For example, in cardiovascular diseases, researchers study young patients with myocardial infarction due to an Asian-specific gene mutation. They combine blood biochemistry indicators to predict the outcome of cardiovascular diseases. In cancer precision medicine, NCKU has established a database of oral cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer samples for analytical platforms. Through AI-assisted biomedical analysis, NCKU can explore genovariation related to Taiwanese specific cancers, and establish a predictive model for assessing cancer re-occurrence to develop treatment strategies. In neurology, NCKU will utilize the support of AI computing to establish clinical indicators for rapid diagnosis of neuropathy caused by cancer chemical treatment. Researchers will combine this with gene exploration to analyze the relationship between genovariation and neuropathy in order to predict which patients are prone to specific types of neuropathy. NCKU's research experience in AI medical treatment and applications not only demonstrates AI application in Medicine, but also acts as the cornerstone of intelligent medical treatment.
The development of AI application in medical treatment requires talents with both backgrounds in medicine and engineering, and powerful hardware. NCKU is now working with NVidia, the world's leading developer of visual computing technology and GPU processors, to use super computers to perform advanced studies on AI-assisted medical treatment, including gene exploration, medical image reading, and medical image restructuring.
成功大學醫學中心與電資學院首次破天荒大規模合作開課，在蘇慧貞校長的推動下，10餘位成大醫學中心的教授及醫師聯手開設「人工智慧於醫療應用與服務」系列課程，將於108學年度進駐電資學院，引領電資學院學生系統性認識AI醫療新藍海。
醫療新藍海的關鍵在找出人工智慧應用的新價值，期待電資學院學生在醫療AI應用上有更多的敏銳度、伸展更多觸角，此次合作可望加強培育工程跨醫學人才，為台灣AI醫療科技發展播下種子，加速實現智慧醫療。「人工智慧於醫療應用與服務」系列課程的授課，是專門為電資學院大三學生設計，期盼擁有工程設計基礎的及工程背景的學生，在臨床醫師的引領下，解讀人工智慧蓬勃發展帶來的醫療革命，並一同探索人工智慧醫療應用的無限可能。
舉例說明，心臟科醫師將為學生講解，如何將電子病歷、檢驗數據、基因庫等海量數據點石成金，轉化有臨床意義的模型，協助診斷與治療決策。醫學影像醫師則從實務案例出發，講解人工智慧如何輔助醫學影像判讀。腫瘤科醫師將談及，如何將繁如天星的基因數據應用於臨床情境。神經醫學科醫師會講述：如何以人工智慧協助診斷複雜的神經病變。
成大醫學中心多年來與國內外一流的大數據專家合作，進行人工智慧醫療相關研究與應用。例如在心血管疾病上，針對年輕的心肌梗塞病患，進行亞洲特有基因序列變異研究、結合血液生化指標，預測心血管疾病走向。在癌症精準醫學方面，成大已建立口腔癌、乳癌、胰臟癌、大腸直腸癌及子宮內膜癌的生醫大數據資料庫及癌症基因分析平台，並透過人工智慧進行生醫大數據分析，探索台灣族群特殊癌症相關的基因型變異，建立評估癌症復發風險的預測模型，發展治療策略。在神經醫學方面則藉由人工智慧運算輔助，建立臨床指標以快速診斷癌症化療引起的神經病變，也配合基因探索分析基因變異和神經病變的關聯性，來預則哪些病患較容易產生這類神經病變。成大在人工智慧醫療應用的研究經驗，不僅呈現了人工智慧於醫學的應用，更是發展智慧醫療的基石。
發展人工智慧的醫療應用，不僅需要兼有醫學及工程背景的人才，還需要強大的硬體為輔。成大現已跟全球視覺運算技術領導廠商與繪圖處理器(GPU)之發明者Nvidia攜手合作，使用超級電腦，進行多項人工智慧醫療前驅研究，包含基因探索、醫學影像判讀、醫學影像重組等。
